## Highlights
- successful institutionalization of so-called post-internet art, which had previously been a low-cost art practice that circulated primarily online. Now it consists of high-budget installations, and is well represented in the art market. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/780486062/3275521))
- Berlin has been thought of as comfort zone where people can escape unpleasant debates around economic issues, income inequality, rates of artist compensation, wage stagnation, and rising tuition costs. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/780486062/3275548))
- will be forced to continue working multiple jobs ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/780486062/3275554))
    - Note: the crossover with my work (that largely deals with white collar employment) is that working class employment requires workers to always be on the clock in the form of multiple jobs
- At this very particular “present” in history, it would be ridiculous if the trajectory of the debate were stuck on the question of either politics or aesthetics ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/780486062/3275594))
- Corporate city branding strategies that promise a generic cosmopolitan experience (“be Berlin,” “I amsterdam,” “OPEN Copenhagen”) should not be confused with the necessity for progressive and engaged culture institutions ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/780486062/3275600))
- Even staying within the safe zone of the art world, why do we keep hearing about new campaigns to save art institutions that are on the brink of disappearing (“Save Malmö Art Academy,” “Save De Appel,” or recently closed institutions like the Townhouse Gallery, YAMA, and SALT Beyoğlu)? Can we even be sure that the Berlin Biennale as we know it will exist much longer? ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/780486062/3275627))
    - Note: foder for a second iteration of 266w25st

- Therefore one should not see catastrophe and human tragedy as time-related or distance-related; they are motion-related and often technology-monitored. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/780486062/3275629))
