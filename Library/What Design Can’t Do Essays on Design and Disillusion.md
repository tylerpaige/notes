  A wicked problem is a problem that can’t be unambiguously and definitively solved because its formulation is incomplete, shifting or even contradictory. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2p0gb5ppav3j726xhfyaw8))
- Their implicit message being that there is no fundamental difference between tools, devices, literature or accessories. Everything is an appendix of identity, something that contributes to a sense of belonging, and in some lucky cases, to the accumulation of prestige. The starter pack meme highlights something else as well, namely that identity formation combines consumption with professional production. Or even that profession is, at least in part, a form of co ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2pp1qv48stgz5s1jmbkvz1))
- There is a growing feeling that both profession and consumption are insufficient means to build a solid, stable identity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2ps1a7qbkvr5dk5kafagyv))
- Guy Julier identifies a turn in design culture taking place between the ’80s and the 2000s. This turn is linked to a new social and economic arrangement generated by neoliberal policies. Economies of Design. Los Angeles: Sage, 2017, p. 14. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2qqjmhhss6csf30x9416d7))
- designers, stuck between the grand project of modernity and the ‘smol’ tactics of everyday life. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2qsyz8hpxnxrwvfhtfvxs1))
- According to cultural theorist Raymond Williams, “one generation may train its successor, with reasonable success, in the social character or the general cultural pattern, but the new generation will have its own structure of feeling, which will not appear to have come ‘from’ anywhere.”36 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2qyw6jn42e96k57q0fv9wm))
- Designers work at the intersection of these trends; their problems are among the key problems of the overdeveloped society. It is their dual investment in them that explains the big split among designers and their frequent guilt; the enriched muddle of ideals they variously profess and the insecurity they often feel about the practice of their craft; their often great disgust and their crippling frustration.47 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2rngr2q608vjyqr55jd30k))
- students “why do we have to assess capitalism? We’re just trying to stage a design conference.” See Alice Twemlow. “‘A Guaranteed Communications Failure:’ ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2rpyfmhfrayeayvpn7k4pw))
- Designers are not used to seeing themselves in the middle: they place themselves at the top of cultural and decision-making processes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khhdahm8za4fxj8v68q8wf82))
- Mills’s diagnosis, however, might not fully apply today. Whereas in the past the designer’s crippling frustration derived from the awareness of being an “organization man,” a cog in the cultural and economic machine, now, given the abundance of designers, the frustration has more to do with being a cog outside the machine, that is, being less and less able to shape its workings.49 After all, Mills was speaking to a crowd of prominent re ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2rt1q63nf7zkfv6ejkyr0f))
- Here, I propose to focus on the ‘interscalar’ gap between the personal tiny and the structural huge, to connect the vector points of individual life to the grand issues rooted in modernity and its crisis. The ’60s white-collar worker was beginning to experience what would become the default torments of the no-collar professional worker, a category that the designer centrally represents: The “new little man […] seems to have no firm roots, no sure loyalties to sustain his life and give it a center […] Perhaps because he does not know where he is going, he is in a frantic hurry; perhaps because he does not know what frightens him, he is paralyzed with fear.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2rwtgbe4ktjeyny3zd63gm))
- Although I agree with Maldonado, this book takes a different approach: it examines hopelessness in itself, resisting the urge of immediately rejecting it, for it is in hopelessness that hope sprouts. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kh2s1xg2qxa1d3k9s5jxzapf))
- Second, a methodological one: given the low access barrier of this field, the everyday designer is more likely to be a graphic designer than a more niche figure. Graphic design is a diluted practice, one in which professionals have to put increasing effort to assert their expertise to clients and society at large. Graphic design is where the necessity of radical openness becomes most obvious, since it’s also where the pro/amateur binary abruptly collapses. Graphic design, one of those “rather inchoate professions” in and around design,58 might even show the general trajectory of professions. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgt72w3yfzcc0sat93y5zss))
- In contrast to this model, I propose to see graphic design as the widest of the orders, as it is more affected by technical, cultural and methodological democratisation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgt8gp88cesepeh63wvm0hs))
    - Note: ok sorry to be critical but this is an example of a citation that added very little other than to show that the author is aware of the citation.
- If we accept whoever professes themselves a designer to be one, we have to see design not just as an activity, but as a community of practice able to provide a sense of belonging. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgtc8d1vcr2tx1gx1ztr0y0))
- I would be tempted to speak of class, if it weren’t for the abysmally different conditions among everyday designers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgtbvh2sfjkb2h6hfydzkb4))
    - Note: ??? avoiding class analysis is the quickest trip to sounding naive
- self-conscious. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgtdtd2cteaaeytd2tzdqdh))
    - Note: interesting definition of “self-conscious” … most people would call this “reflexive” but ok. good to note for understanding later arguments
- In this sense, the notion of everyday designer differs profoundly from the generalist claim that “everyone is a designer,” a claim that can be either a defence of autonomy or a form of libertarian individualism ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgtjmb5xvfha2xy3bhy2p6k))
    - Note: Q: How does this statement defend design’s autonomy? If I recall correctly, my understanding of design autonomy (derived from figures like Andrew Blauvelt) refers to designers being able to construct formal language to support their chosen ideology — in contrast to design being used to just dress up and stylize some third party’s ideology. If that’s the case, then why would “everyone is a designer” defend that position?
      A: Lorusso shows that “everyone is a designer” can be deployed rhetorically to expand design’s remit and legitimize design thinking as a general cultural competence, which supports autonomy by claiming design’s epistemic authority beyond commissions — i.e. design can generate meaning on its own terms. But he also warns this move is ambiguous: it can empower designers’ claim to self-directed authorship (Blauvelt’s “critical autonomy”) or dissolve professional authority by dispersing agency into tools, managers and users, turning the slogan into either a defense of autonomy or its erosion.
      —-
      Ok… Well in any sense, Lorusso is saying that the “everyday designer” is *not* the canva user.
- In other words, the everyday designer is explicitly a designer in a world where everybody designs. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgthy3nc0a2a63ph4kr213g))
- This point is slightly controversial, as I sense that the professionals of design discourse are abandoning the profession as a matter of concern. See chapter 7. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgtga248seysr4nqh8rwge3))
- bricoleur ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgv5cyp6x0qzd3y34j70fs2))
    - Note: Bricolage is a French wording meaning roughly ‘do-it-yourself’, and it is applied in an art context to artists who use a diverse range of non-traditional art materials.
      This approach became popular in the early twentieth century when resources were scarce, and aspects of surrealism, dada and cubism have a bricolage character. But it was not until the early 1960s, with the formation of the Italian movement arte povera, that bricolage took on a political aspect and it was used by artists to bypass the commercialism of the art world. Arte povera artists constructed sculptures out of rubbish in an attempt to devalue the art object and assert the value of the ordinary and everyday.
      Since then, artists have continued to make art out of detritus – for example, Tomoko Takahashi constructs vast sculptures of junk found on the streets as a comment on the disposable nature of our culture and society.
- both aspects that challenge the compromised vocational image of the designer as planner. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgv9ex39gjq75121e80yee9))
- Memes also reflect the everyday designer’s condition: disillusioned designers won’t write papers to express their chagrin, they don’t have time for that. They will make a meme instead. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgva9axdcehedkt4q3zqkmn))
    - Note: This is an interesting argument: the meme as the most accessible form of public grievance.
- The everyday designer is located between these poles – not fully recognised as an expert, but also not a mere human being who plans ahead. The notion of the everyday designer sheds light on the fact that divides based on professionalism and expertise are nuanced, complicated and, more importantly, dynamic. The point is not only that these divides do not dignify practices that aren’t traditionally recognised by the design field, but also that expertise and professionalism are categories in constant renegotiation ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgvd37gb1zh9sk2by0hrt8n))
- In The Politics of the Artificial, Margolin warns us that “if designers are going to realize the full potential of design thought, then they should also learn to analyze how the situations that frame design practice are themselves constructed.”64 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgvf0ezsqnp2kkd3yymc5ys))
    - Note: I see this as a good argument for teaching the way that I do
- “How and to what extent modernity’s promise of designability of one’s own life has been fulfilled is obviously an open question.” This is the question we are tackling here, however not in general terms ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgvj5p1swasd7h04ag3444s))
- what is the horizon of designability of one’s own design practice? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgvm906qv4eekjv39pqshg2))
- The everyday designer is always working with a set of constraints that do not only belong to the internal logic of the design, but to its presence in the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgvnrxj1ms6cscdffngzj0c))
    - Note: Another good argument for teaching the way that I do. Basically, any design you may exists in a complex arrangement of social, political, economic forces. The thing you make will be read in that context. And of course context influences reading. So it’s important to be aware of those forces in order to maintain your desired legibility.
      Also, isn’t this statement true for famous designers as well?
- as Julier points out: “Designers’ responsiveness to changing commercial contexts results in rapid reinventions of the professional field – a constant redesign of design itself.”68 Their practice is inevitably compromising. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgvve3k2wyj8xec6vbmp7jj))
    - Note: This Julier text sounds like it’s good — maybe better than Lorusso’s
- In Manzini’s words, “in order to
  adapt to what is required of them, they must redesign themselves and their way of operating. But then this is what is required of everybody today.”69 If the modern project does not fulfil its promises of identity, administration and prosperity, the designer, being one of its poster children, becomes a hypermodern post-professional figure, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgvytxa1zkpr7t3qahn9wg7))
- located between autonomy and dependence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgw03q7xg25c931kdhase3k))
- The weak, depressed, self-critical, virtual self is essentially that endlessly adaptable subject required by the ceaseless innovation of production, the accelerated obsolescence of technologies, the constant overturning of social norms, and generalized flexibility. It is at the same time the most voracious consumer and, paradoxically, the most productive self, the one that will most eagerly and energetically throw itself into the slightest project, only to return later to its original larval state.7 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgw1qyf0fm8m1w01g64wf35))
- The leap from the vita contemplativa of the design school to the vita activa of independent or studio work is seldom devoid of trauma ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgw6f9rkmq1bbrxdtyx029q))
    - Note: i like these words
- To begin with, there is the feeling of a decreasing return of investment from higher education, with the subsequent idea that a study loan spent on rising fees and rent might not be a good deal ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgwam5whyp8p8fzpb0zmt80))
    - Note: While I agree with this sentiment generally, I think it largely stems from an inability to see the human value of education, separate from the productive value of education.
      Secondly, every time I see arguments like this, I wonder how much the argument has been influenced by right wing politics, which seeks to denigrate education to in order to make exploitable subjects.
- Or, more precisely, not everything should be reduced to this relationship in its most general sense. The risk here is to perform Capital’s job of abstracting lived practices and treat them as generic, ‘lo-res’ instances of exploitation. This usually leads to sacrosanct but also interchangeable calls for unionisation, petitions to ‘pay your interns,’ etc ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgwjpf330ext0vtn3s9656w))
- shouldn’t treat the designer (or any other kind of practitioner, for that matter) as an economically-determined stick figure who doesn’t possess any specificity other than being a ‘cultural worker.’ We shouldn’t miss the specific manifestations of design’s liaison with capitalism. This oversight might be strategically valid from the point of view of ‘praxis,’ but it is less so when it comes to comprehend the designer’s condition. Instead, the question we need to ask is: how does design differ from other activities entrenched in capitalism? Let’s begin with design culture’s default optimistic attitude. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgwnc0mbv3fzb2ynb6gjt11))
    - Note: now we’re getting somewhere
- “Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.”81 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgwt0p04m9enfadvts5ecyt))
    - Note: Interesting but ultimately situates design as “problem solving” which is so clearly an outdated definition
- Marco Petroni argues that “[t] oo often in the world of design the harshness of the real is accepted only when translated or rendered imaginative.”82 This translation, which is what we call a project, is also a way of projecting oneself outside reality. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgwqqjx5fd0zc6w64yx63cg))
    - Note: Wow. Well said. Honestly speaks to some of the lingering distinctions between art and design
- The unchangeable is design’s taboo ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgww4jd5h9gqw5dkh0e0t65))
- Separated from his impotentiality, deprived of the experience of what he can not do, today’s man believes himself capable of everything, and so he repeats his jovial ‘no problem,’ and his irresponsible ‘I can do it,’ precisely when he should instead realize that he has been consigned in unheard of measure to forces and processes over which he has lost all his control. He has become blind not to his capacities but to his incapacities, not to what he can do but to what he cannot, or can not, do.83 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgwwksx9ff71phdeahr3eay))
    - Note: Damn I GOTTA read Agamben
- Instead of listing such expressions of disenchantment one by one, we can highlight instead certain recurring themes: mechanisation and rationalisation; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgwz9wm9ak943rvrm51w6vb))
    - Note: Contemporary design’s political/economy affects in brief
- division of labour with its dulling effects; exploitation of natural and human resources; lack of meaning, autonomy and legitimacy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgwz2gt7r6yn9dv4bpnvbsz))
- What Ruskin didn’t like of servile ornament was basically the division of labour that such a style implied. This division of labour causes a ‘mechanisation’ of the labourers’ work, so they lose autonomy, and therefore meaning in what they do ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgx38ne8kz764f2qkq69h1z))
    - Note: I’m really into this tale
- Despairing of the limits of human knowledge, she is paralyzed and unable to create, as the discarded and unused tools suggest. Ironically, this anguished representation of artistic impotence has proved a shining and enduring example of the power of Dürer’s art.88 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgx8yd5khx8efa9rdw0kjf2))
    - Note: Exactly! It’s stuff like this that really demonstrates that art has power. If what’s being communicated has resonance, it will be powerful
- good representation of disillusioned everyday designers. Surrounded by a chaotic profusion of technological and methodological possibilities, they ponder their inability to achieve in their projects (their life being one of them) an ideal of perfection – or at least meaningfulness.90 ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khgxdj7eeb4355tp0fzxdyht))
    - Note: Damnnnnn this is so good
- Design illusions include those fits of collective enthusiasm that influence and shape the design field. H ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khj5ggcsskhbpgxqqwemzn1v))
- The first kind allows us to reconsider what design is, the second how design relates to other disciplines, the third what design can do. In three words: being, autonomy, power. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khj5htz8ztng51kbhcx9w4xx))
- 2003.110 This doesn’t seem to be just an isolated impression: when a group of researchers employed data mining techniques to examine two decades’ worth of conversations on the PhD-Design discussion list, an established platform for specialised exchange, they discovered that there had been minimal advancement in defining design.111 Today, the doubtful designer asks: how can something so indefinite define the world? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khj84mqfk47akjxfz4r01qh0))
- Recognising the reductive appropriation of pre-existing practices through design as a bureaucratic cultural instrument, they nevertheless cling to their authority, real or perceived, sensing that it is ineffective, provisional – if not illegitimate. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khj852bx2x2nd5fc49mhpjz5))
    - Note: there is a lot to say about design’s relationship to bureaucracy
- To understand more clearly what this life-skill is about, we
  can consult an unlikely source, Karl Marx’s Das Kapital ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khj88q9m81vtvp02yrvt9yvd))
    - Note: why would this be unexpected
- Proponents of an ontological idea of design like Tony Fry and Anne-Marie Willis add another element to design panism by suggesting that not just everything is design, and not only everyone is a designer, but also everyone is in turn designed by design, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01khj8c3nb8bq66970qmxed91n))
    - Note: Yawn. Obviously people are shaped by context. But context is not a *designer*. You can’t just say anything that causes an effect is a designer. How silly.
