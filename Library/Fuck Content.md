Summary: Design is not just about content but how that content is shaped and presented. The meaning of design comes from its form and style, not just the story it tells. Good design speaks through its visual treatment, creating a unique message beyond the content itself.
Document Note: He is so whatever to me. It’s not that I disagree with his argument. It’s more so that I think he seems to misunderstand what is happening. Of course design influences meaning and thus creates a kind of authorship. That is obvious to everyone. What people are advocating for when asking for “design as authorship” is to pursue forms of content production that only a designer would think to make. Like think about visual storytelling at a newspaper. A reporter would tell the story with words then have a designer decorate it. A visual journalist thinks about visual opportunities to do the telling. It’s not rocket science. 
 I suppose his argument is that people are quick to diminish “style” as vapid, superficial, etc. And so he is writing to affirm that form really does matter, and that form communicates. Sure, no argument there. It’s kind of a boring point though, and being so emphatic about it makes him seem reactionary
 His assertion that designers are interested in carving out this position because of vanity or self-conscious is very telling. 
 Ultimately I think this is a really unremarkable piece of writing and it's probably only well known because of his previously existing celebrity status.

## Highlights
- However, it has often been read as a call for designers to generate content: in effect, to become designers and authors, not designers as authors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfd918tdek8e36t8xg9m1kz3))
    - Note: I understood it to mean the opposite actually
- At a 1962 conference at the Museum of Modern Art, conservative art critic Hilton Kramer denounced Pop Art as “indistinguishable from advertising art” because “Pop Art does not tell us what it feels like to be living through the present moment of civilization. Its social effect is simply to reconcile us to a world of commodities, banalities and vulgarities.” But perhaps the *content* of graphic design is exactly that: an evocation of “what it feels like to be living through the present moment of civilization,” with all its “commodities, banalities and vulgarities.” How else can we discuss the content of a typeface or why the typography of a surfing magazine suddenly becomes relevant? Or how a series of made-up or ‘self-initiated’ posters—already a medium of dubious functionality— can end up on the wall of a major design museum? Work must be saying something, which is different than being *about* something. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfd9jcnyebbvckrz5cj010c1))
    - Note: The sentences in this paragraph seem completely unrelated to one another
- We are intimately, physically connected to the work we produce, and it is inevitable that our work bears our stamp. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfd9s1he20zjgsws9ef4drn9))
    - Note: Citation needed lol. I feel this way about my own work, but I don’t know if every designer does. I think some people thoughtlessly apply style. I think other people feel they are scientists arriving at the mathematical best formatting, such that it has little to do with their personal subjectivity
- This deep connection to making also positions design in a modulating role between the user and the world. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfda0615f4makfvvs4ym60xh))
    - Note: What??
- Form is replaced by exchange. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfda0vxqbt5g21r45s56fxh2))
    - Note: What???
- The trick is to find ways to speak through treatment, via a range of rhetorical devices— from the written to the visual to the operational—to make those proclamations as poignant as possible, and to return consistently to central ideas, to re-examine and re-express. In this way we build a body of work, and from that body of work emerges a singular message, maybe even *what it feels like to be living now*.
