Summary: Memes are cultural units that spread by imitation and can influence politics by disrupting normal communication. Digital networks help memes spread quickly, but their appeal depends on being catchy and meaningful. Jokes and memes can challenge power by undermining traditional debate and becoming tools for activism.

## Highlights
- Memes play a distinct role in protest; they seem to be to the resistance of today what "political posters" were to yesterday – the embodiment of shared ideas in a community. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kgzdrfv3svvcxkdsbvgr7q94))
- "Cultural transmission, " Dawkins said, "is analogous to genetic transmission in that, although basically conservative, it can give rise to a form of evolution." ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg3hxtg3mptpf90gq9wqpk95))
    - Note: im interesting in the idea of cultural transmisison being conservative. i suppose the idea is that it spreads sameness?
- There are three qualities that define the success of memes: longevity, fecundity, and copying-fidelity. Longevity indicates how long a meme can last. Fecundity applies to the appeal of a meme, whether it is catchy and thus likely to spread. Copying-fidelity is about the strength of a meme to withstand mutation in the process of copying and imitation. It determines how much of the original core remains intact when the meme is in transmission. All three criteria also apply to jokes, but the joke was not mentioned by Dawkins as an example of a meme.

- Further study into the nature of self-referentiality was done by Susan Stewart in her legendary book, Nonsense. For Stewart, the category of "nonsense" is opposed to the category of "common sense making" through which what we think of as reality is established. By categorising something as "nonsense" , "the legitimacy and rationality of sense making was left uncontaminated, unthreatened." [23](https://readwise.io/reader/document_raw_content/334854189/#page-18-7)
  It is not difficult to see a fundamental political procedure at work here. Isn't it exactly the day job of most politicians to manage reality and sense-making, deciding what others get to see as nonsense and what as legit?

- Time, explained Dawkins, constitutes a major limit on the success of individual memes. No one person can do more than only a few things at once. Consequently, said Richard Dawkins, "if a meme is to dominate the attention of a human brain, it must do so at the expense of 'rival' memes."
  Digital networks and social media do not dissolve the limits in attention that the human brain can give to any meme, but they do more or less solve two out of the three criteria that, according to Dawkins,
  determine a meme's success: longevity and copying-fidelity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg3kf2br1ha4h1jcm3j1j89c))
- Every era, every generation, has to construct and reconstruct its political beliefs, and subsequent visuals, out of the stuff that surrounds it at any given moment. Protest signs will be made out of the cardboard, paper and textile available at that given time and place at a local hardware store; there is no hardware store selling "political" cardboard, so even at that material level, a transformation always has to be made. The same goes for the visual stuff of the internet; every generation will construct new, "political" beliefs out of it; out of all kinds of stuff, which seemed initially non-political.

- The original maker of a joke often, and ideally, remains anonymous. He or she is truly a designer. We consider a designer here to be any formmaker, regardless of material; design is merely a few decisions on a form and its boundary—in jokes, this consists of what is said and importantly, what is not said. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg8pheyebttfb4rbt7rbtp5m))
- Reality management, or sense-making, is establishing a frame in which certain things can be claimed not to have happened. Jokes are by virtue of their disruption of an existing order of "sense-making" very unwelcome guests in an age of austerity. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg8pjdwfqy6dt8paax90hwbc))
- Responding to a sensical question with a meaningless answer is an effective tool to negate the politics of the frame in which the question was posed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg8px6b8nr69vbesckdhv12g))
- The absurd response refuses to participate in this exercise. It removes itself from the frame. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg8pxmq7s4e77bd4hb6z5g48))
- The joke as a disruption of the symbolic order is useful in taking on the antagonist not through a formal and recognisable disagreement in content but instead as an attempt to negate the form of legitimate rational debate as they might have otherwise naturally presumed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg8pz0f5ja6sq8tj6ncz7h8z))
    - Note: trump
- One sees this in jokes on placards at protests or stupid costumes – when protests aim at this alone they appear impotent and a meek attempt at 'subversion', which is ultimately bereft of power. This itself might be understood as the symbolic disruption of order as opposed to the disruption of the symbolic order, a key difference between spectacle and antagonism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg8q23j092ddys2daq08ntec))
    - Note: no kings
- is this mixture of the disruption of the symbolic order at a number of levels, both the physical and the communicative that disconcerts the powerful the most. When one has physical disruption but maintains a communicative order with demands then such disruption is still capable of mediation. However – when done at both the level of the symbolic and the physical the powerful inevitably ask, 'what do these people want?'
