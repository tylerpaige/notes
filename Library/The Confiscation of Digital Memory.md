## Highlights
- Unlike physical artifacts that can survive neglect — a photo album can be quietly preserved in a drawer for decades — websites require constant care to survive. Their existence depends on a stream of maintenance: server costs must be paid, domain names renewed, legacy code updated. In practice, this makes the web a particularly impermanent medium.
- I often joke that every idea I can think of was likely discussed two decades ago on some subdomain of cult.bg or dir.bg — but fortunately, no one will bother to look.
- In a place where even physical heritage crumbles, who would care about digital memory?
- The new authorities labeled this sentiment Yugonostalgia, a term used not just to dismiss longing for the past but to cast suspicion on those who remembered it — being nostalgic for Yugoslavia made you a suspect, a threat to the new democratic order.
- “The past must be articulated in order to become memory,” she wrote. But when all traces of that past are erased, articulation becomes impossible.
- She contrasts Yugonostalgia with American nostalgia, which functions more as a marketing engine powering endless reboots and revivals: “While in America everything rapidly ‘becomes the past,’ it seems that nothing disappears.
- “It’s not our job to figure out what’s valuable, to figure out what’s meaningful… We work by three virtues: rage, paranoia, and kleptomania.”
- Some governments have addressed this by mandating national libraries to archive websites on their country’s domains and content in their languages across popular platforms.
