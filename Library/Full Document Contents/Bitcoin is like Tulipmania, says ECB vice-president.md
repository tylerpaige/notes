One of the eurozone’s most senior central bankers has waded into [the debate over bitcoin](https://archive.is/o/Yqgp8/https://www.ft.com/indepth/bitcoin), dismissing the cryptocurrency as “an instrument of speculation” and saying its sharp rise in value was akin to the 17th century tulip craze.

The views of Vítor Constâncio, the vice-president of the European Central Bank, echo those of JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon, who has described bitcoin as a “fraud”.

“Bitcoin is a sort of tulip,” Mr Constâncio said. Tulipmania, which erupted in the Netherlands in the 1600s, is often cited as one of the oldest examples of a financial bubble.

“It’s an instrument of speculation,” the ECB vice-president told the audience at a conference in Frankfurt on Friday. “But [it is] certainly not a currency and we don’t see it as a threat to central bank policy.”

Bitcoin’s value slumped last week after Mr Dimon said the cryptocurrency was [“worse than tulip bulbs”](https://archive.is/o/Yqgp8/https://www.ft.com/content/b1ee6c14-2cd0-3ad5-a9db-c8e82d993987). The phenomenon was a “fraud”, he added, saying it was only useful to drug dealers, murderers or the inhabitants of North Korea.

Bitcoin was trading at an all-time high of $4,911 at the beginning of this month, before falling to $3,899 after Mr Dimon’s comments. On Friday afternoon a bitcoin was worth $3,299.

Mr Dimon is known for expressing strong views but the outburst against bitcoin surprised some peers in the industry. Many banks are [embracing both bitcoin](https://archive.is/o/Yqgp8/https://www.ft.com/content/83a496fe-995b-11e7-b83c-9588e51488a0) and the blockchain technology that underpins it.

As issuers and guardians of official currencies, central bankers have faced questions about whether these private-sector rivals threaten their ability to control the supply of money.

Earlier on Friday ECB president Mario Draghi said in Dublin that the central bank did not think cryptocurrencies posed a threat to the euro or the bank’s monetary policy but said cyber risk posed one of the most important dangers for the stability of the financial system.

Mr Draghi this month hit back at a paper by an Estonian government official that mooted the idea of the Baltic state — which sees itself as something of a digital pioneer — creating its own cryptocurrency. “No member state can introduce its own currency; the currency of the eurozone is the euro,” the ECB president said.

Speaking on the same panel as Mr Constâncio, Huw van Steenis, global head of strategy at Schroders, an asset manager, said: “As cryptocurrencies grow, we should expect more central bankers to look to outlaw or crimp their use.

“This will be most acute in markets which are worried about capital flight and organised crime. This won’t stop speculators and enthusiasts, but will limit their potential to create the powerful network effects which would make them a useful parallel currency,” Mr van Steenis said.

In the tulip crisis there was an underlying asset, a real asset : tulips. With Bitcoin there is nothing : just a game and a bet.

It is because it is a global game, and nothing else, that it will have a bright future !

Rich for the ECB to criticise bitcoin when they oversea a truly frightening currency with a questionable future. At least bitcoin doesn't cause mass unemployment in the south and make the North artificially rich.

Bitcoin has been declared dead, or a fraud, or a bubble, no less than 166 times since it launched in 2009. There can only be one answer - it's a zombie currency! It refuses to die.

I dismiss central bankers as a fad

Old but not fake news:

[https://silverberg-on-meltdown-economics.blogspot.com/2013/04/jan-brueghel-youngers-take-on-bitcoin.html](https://archive.is/o/Yqgp8/https://silverberg-on-meltdown-economics.blogspot.com/2013/04/jan-brueghel-youngers-take-on-bitcoin.html)

Bitcoin is a fraud by its very nature that makes it possible to reach a ceiling in its liquidity. There is a finite limit to the achievability of another bitcoin based on the power of cheap but powerful computers on offer to "so-called" miners. Evidence that this is becoming unprofitable is that AMD and Nvidia chips are becoming less used by bitcoin miners. Super computers such as Kray's etc become more appropriate as tools for keen "bitminers" , but there will be an economic gap between the two activities.

The fact that the value of bitcoin could fall by nearly $2,000 merely due to Mr. Dimon’s comments is perhaps an indicator that this is not a stable asset with a rationally determined value.

I believe that most informed people think that the fall was not because of Mr Dimon, but because to the Chinese government moved against china based exchanges.

I agree. This report has left out some other rather more important news other than the ramblings of a financial dinosaur. China has closed all trading exchanges 'for the time being'. This has much more to do with recent price moves than the musings of a Bank CEO who has overseen $27B in fines since the 2008 crisis. He's probably worried that decentralised, trustless systems might see him off before he hits retirement.

Maybe the problem is with your ignorance. Bitcoin fell because China banned trading of all cryptocurrencies not because of the Dimons opened his mouth

Clearly, Japan disagrees with the ECB and JP Morgan. And if China feels the need to ban it, it would appear that autocratic institutions are most threatened by it.

Is "But, Japan!!" the new "But, Venezuela!!"? Where you say the name of a country that may have had vaguely-related news stories, but - and this is important - you don't actually make a falsifiable claim?

'Cos last I heard, Bank of Japan thought Blockchain was pants. [https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2017/09/06/european-central-bank-and-bank-of-japan-distributed-ledger-technology-immature-not-a-solution/](https://archive.is/o/Yqgp8/https://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2017/09/06/european-central-bank-and-bank-of-japan-distributed-ledger-technology-immature-not-a-solution/)

If you mean some payment processor will accept it, maybe, but that doesn't translate to volume in shops.

If you mean they've declared it something exchanges are allowed to trade in, that means it hasn't been ruled illegal, which is quite a different matter.

If you mean an airline used the word to get publicity, that only means they said they may accept it from 2018 possibly.

So, what's the actual claim you're making?

Well, they once said the same about the internet! Hell, in the 90's they even produced a film "Shooting Fish" to assert the same. Many British commentators claimed at the time that'll be no bigger than CB radios, and mobile phones would be the more impactful technology. A US executive also claimed that the early internet was communist! Every bit of internet related technology from browsers to search engines to social media was at one time called a con. Every industry the internet impacted on from Newspapers to Films to Music to Finance once called it a con. So no surprise, those who believe will pursue it to fruition others especially establishment dinosaurs will ignore it until it renders them extinct.

> Well, they once said the same about the internet!

This fallacy is known as the "Galileo gambit": [http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Galileo\_gambit](https://archive.is/o/Yqgp8/rationalwiki.org/wiki/Galileo_gambit)

The fallacy goes:

1. They made fun of Galileo, and he was right.  

2. They make fun of me, therefore *I* am right.

or, formally:

**P1:** **A** is **X** and **Y**  

**P2:** **B** is **X**.  

**C1:** **B** is **Y**.

The trouble is, of course, they made fun of Galileo, but they also made fun of Bozo the Clown.

More specifically: Bitcoin boosters always compare Bitcoin to technologies that were hugely successful. However, this is asserting their conclusion - because they don't justify why they shouldn't compare Bitcoin to the many, many more technologies that were not successful, despite seeming like a good idea at the time. "Bitcoin: the Microsoft Network of money!" sounds rather less impressive.

In the case of Bitcoin, the closest comparison to a successful technology would be Git, the most popular system for saving computer programming code in. It's the closest thing I can think of to a useful blockchain-like technology: it saves individual code edits as transactions in Merkle trees with tamper-evident hashes, and developers routinely copy entire Git repositories around, identifying them by hash. It’s a distributed ledger, but for computer programs rather than money.

What it doesn’t have is the blockchain consensus mechanism, the mining, the coins, etc – you take or leave the version of the repository you’re offered.

It's also what the only actually useful business products tagged "blockchain" will turn out to be - that is, append-only transaction ledgers tamper-proofed by cryptographic hashes. Even if it doesn't add the mining, the coins, the consensus, etc. that is what Bitcoin actually added.

Git was released in 2005 and was based on work going back to the late 1990s; Merkle trees were invented in 1979. The good bits of blockchain are not original, and the original bits of blockchain turn out not to be much good.

(But if you use Git, you can tell your management “oh yes, we’ve been using *blockchain-related technologies* for years now …”)

Possibly the best comment of 2017.

David Gerard The actual innovation of blockchain over previous Merkle tree systems is precisely the consensus mechanism achieved by mining

So yeah, current "blockchain technologies" that are simply Merkle trees are a misnomer

David Gerard As you are well aware, Git is a piece of software and Github is a hugely popular centralized "bank" that uses Git software to store any digital data (not just software).

Saying they are more useful that blockchain ignores the core value of blockchain - that it is decentralized and hence there is no one point of failure.

If Github, the company, disappears then so does everything that they stored. Yes, perhaps there are some copies stored but that is not guaranteed. Blockchain attempts to solve that single point of failure problem by incentivising people to copy the data (blockchain).

Even if Bitcoin is only useful for nefarious activities - and even the central bankers admit this is a good use of blockchain - then it has value. But then again so does the 500 Euro notes which have many of the same characteristics as bitcoin - annoymous, easy to transport, hard to trace, widely recognized.

Ironically, remthe ECB plans to remove those notes from circulationin 2108 - which will increase the demand for cryptocurrencies.
