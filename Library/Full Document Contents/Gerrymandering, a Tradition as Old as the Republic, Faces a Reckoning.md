Democrat Cory Mason won a seat in the Wisconsin Assembly by fewer than 1,000 votes in 2006. District 62 was sandwiched between one heavily Democratic district and another that strongly favored Republicans, like this:

In 2010, a nationwide Republican wave swept the GOP into the Wisconsin governor’s mansion and legislature, giving the party the power to redraw the state’s electoral map for the first time in half a century.

The result transformed Mr. Mason’s political life. The new District 62 separated him from most of his old constituents in Racine, Wis., and swept in rural and conservative precincts from elsewhere. He was stuck in a red district with just a comma-shaped sliver of blue.

To stay in office, Mr. Mason moved to District 66, which, as the following map shows, had become an island of Democratic strength.

Republicans engineered similar moves across Wisconsin, erecting a firewall that helped protect the GOP’s majority of 60 seats in the 99-member Assembly. The new lines withstood a shift of more than 400,000 votes to Democrats in the 2012 state elections.

Gerrymandering: The Game!

Welcome to Statesota

Population 12

![](https://asset.wsj.net/wsjnewsgraphics/gerrymander/assets/challenge-1.png)
The state is evenly split between voters from the Purple and Yellow parties. Ideally, candidates from either would have a fair shot at winning.

Can you create three districts with an even number of purple and yellow voters in each one?

What happened to Mr. Mason is now [part of a Supreme Court case](https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-to-consider-limits-on-partisan-drawing-of-election-maps-1497881169?mod=article_inline) that will decide the future of political gerrymandering, a phenomenon with a rich, bipartisan tradition. Since the founding of the republic, Democrats and Republicans have sought to redraw maps that increase their party’s electoral clout, largely by creating a greater number of winnable seats.

The Supreme Court is in a position, if it chooses, to create the first nationwide definition of how much partisanship in redistricting is too much. The high court has never found a partisan gerrymander unconstitutional, partly because the justices haven’t been able to agree on a method to determine what too much looks like.

Lately, most of the gains nationally from redistricting have gone to Republicans due to their election successes in 2010. The rise of computer-powered voter analysis, which allows electoral maps to be redrawn with more precision than ever, has supercharged both parties’ efforts.

In Wisconsin, nearly two-thirds of state assembly seats were won by Republicans last year when the party won 53% of votes statewide. There was almost no such gap in 2008, as these charts show:

In November, [federal judges in Madison, Wis.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-court-panel-rules-wisconsin-legislative-map-is-unconstitutional-1479769469?mod=article_inline), ruled the new maps unconstitutional and “[intended to burden the representational rights](http://www.wiwd.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/15cv421_Order.pdf) of Democratic voters…by impeding their ability to translate their votes into legislative seats.”

Wisconsin appealed, and the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in the case Tuesday.

A ruling against Wisconsin could lead to major changes in how political maps are drawn, forcing both parties to restrain their partisan motives. Much of the impact would be felt in the next round of redistricting after the 2020 census, a process that will shape the balance of power in federal, state and local districts across the country.

Wisconsin’s Republican attorney general, Brad Schimel, says GOP lawmakers followed traditional practices in producing the current map, such as making districts compact, tidy and with normal-looking shapes.

The November ruling cited evidence Republican leaders were presented with a range of map options and chose the one that was the most partisan. “That’s their prerogative,” Mr. Schimel said. “It’s a political process.”

Mr. Schimel says using the challengers’ legal arguments as a nationwide constitutional test would invalidate a third of the legislative maps drawn in the past 45 years. If the Supreme Court rules against Wisconsin, “it is going to lead to endless litigation over every map that is drawn,” says Mr. Schimel.

Running alongside the Wisconsin case is one from Maryland involving U.S. House districts. Two years ago, the Supreme Court ordered a three-judge panel in Baltimore to consider whether a 2011 redistricting plan drafted by Gov. Martin O’Malley, a Democrat, disenfranchised Republicans.

The map resulted in Democratic majorities in seven of Maryland’s eight congressional districts and helped cost Republicans one of their two House seats. The case is on hold until the Supreme Court decides the Wisconsin case.

“The Governor’s map is not pretty,” said a memo prepared in 2011 for the state Senate’s president, a Democrat.

Before the redistricting, Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District was anchored by rural, western Republican strongholds that, as the map below shows, stretched all the way across the border with West Virginia.

Democratic officials said they wanted to make the district more competitive and reflective of the party’s growth in Frederick, western Maryland’s largest city. Maryland Democrats redrew the sixth district by removing GOP precincts in the east and adding the more-liberal suburbs that stretched south toward Washington, D.C. The new House district was smaller and less Republican:

The impact was clear in the 2014 election, says Sharon Strine, a seventh-generation Wolfsville resident and one of the Republican plaintiffs. She ran the campaign of GOP challenger Dan Bongino.

“We were ahead on election night, when every precinct was in except for three precincts in Montgomery County,” a heavily Democratic suburb of Washington, she says. When those votes were counted, Mr. Bongino lost by less than 3,000 out of a total of 190,000.

![](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-VI281_0928GE_M_20170928124802.jpg) Sharon Strine, a full-time farmer and part-time political consultant in Wolfsville, Md. She is a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the redrawing of districts in Maryland by Democrats. Photo: John Boal for The Wall Street Journal 
Ms. Strine says the district’s western end is “just a different breed of people” from those tacked onto the district by Mr. O’Malley.

Mr. O’Malley, who left office in 2015, said in a deposition he acted “constitutionally and legally” under the system he inherited. Still, he added, “Let me state unequivocally, categorically. I believe that our whole country needs to develop a better process for congressional redistricting.”

[The case against gerrymandering](https://www.wsj.com/articles/formula-measures-impact-of-partisan-gerrymandering-1498222800?mod=article_inline) contends the process violates the idea that voters should get to choose their representatives, rather than the other way around. Redrawing lines to maximize partisan gains, the argument goes, allows parties to win seats in numbers that disproportionately reflect their popular support and can turn voters into voiceless minorities.

Sens. John McCain (R., Ariz.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D., R.I.) told the Supreme Court that the proliferation of safe districts accelerates polarization.

“[An incumbent’s biggest threat](https://www.mccain.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/931d5a3b-d388-4f90-96ee-0daf265ebd05/mccain-whitehouse-whitford-amicus-brief---9.5.17.pdf) is often a primary challenge from a more extreme member of his or her own party,” the two senators wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief. “This threat makes legislators reluctant to work across the aisle and support bipartisan legislation.”

The increasing homogeneity can be seen in the decline of competitive House districts, defined in this chart as “swing seats” that vote roughly in line with the U.S. as a whole.

The Republican State Leadership Committee, which ran [a project called Redmap](http://www.redistrictingmajorityproject.com/) to maximize power through redistricting, including in Wisconsin, said in its brief that voters prefer noncompetitive districts because they produce representatives who conform ideologically with more constituents.

The Supreme Court has been reluctant to interfere in the process. It wasn’t until 1962, faced with districts not revised in decades, that the court ruled political maps could be challenged in court. The court has struck down maps designed to disenfranchise African-Americans and other minorities, but hasn’t ruled against either party for using redistricting power to undermine the other.

#### A Trip Through Maryland’s Sixth Congressional District

#### In 2011, Democrats added suburban voters to a largely rural district that stretches about 150 miles.

Downtown Smithsburg, Md., is near the line between two congressional districts. Democrats removed Republican precincts from one district and added Democratic precincts.

In 2004, conservative Supreme Court justices came one vote short of closing the door to challenges of partisan gerrymandering. At the time, justices said a map can look more or less problematic from one election to the next as voters’ political affiliations change.

The pivotal vote in the 2004 ruling belonged to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who rejected the claim against Pennsylvania’s congressional map but left open the possibility that voters might bring a successful claim someday.

Some historians credit the first congressional gerrymandering to Patrick Henry for drawing Virginia’s Fifth District in 1788 to hurt James Madison’s election chances. Mr. Madison won anyway. The term comes from this salamander-shaped Massachusetts state Senate district, approved in 1812 by Gov. Elbridge Gerry:

![](https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-VI265_0928GE_16RH_20170928124511.jpg) Photo: Bettmann Archive/Getty Images 
Political scientists Bernard Grofman and Ronald Keith Gaddie told the Supreme Court in a brief filed in the Wisconsin case there is “compelling evidence that the 2010 redistricting cycle yielded [partisan gerrymandering of a magnitude](http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/sites/default/files/16-1161acBernardGrofmanAndRonaldGaddie.pdf) that is qualitatively and quantitatively different from what we have seen in the past.” Mr. Gaddie served as a consultant to Wisconsin Republicans during the redistricting process.

There are two common redistricting strategies. “Packing” crams the minority party’s voters in one district to weaken their influence in other districts nearby. Parts of Eau Claire used to be in two competitive districts with a mix of GOP and Democratic voters.

Since 2011, Eau Claire has been largely lumped into a single Assembly district—the 91st, at the center of the 2016 graphic below—which is filled with Democrats. All the districts around it are now Republican.

“Cracking” divides the minority party’s voters into more than one district to dilute their voting power. In Sheboygan, about 250 miles from Eau Claire on Lake Michigan, a new map line along Superior Avenue split the city into two new districts, both now held by Republicans.

Mary Lynne Donohue, a Democratic plaintiff in Sheboygan, says her Republican representative “is a nice, decent man” but “doesn’t have to listen to me.”

Republicans say complaints about unfairness are sour grapes. “We have better candidates, better issues and a better understanding of what our constituents want to do,” says GOP state Rep. Kathleen Bernier of District 68, near Eau Claire.

Mr. Mason, the Democrat from Racine who moved to stay in office, says he had trouble working with Republicans to accomplish much beyond small issues. In 2013, he made a successful proposal to name the kringle the [official state pastry of Wisconsin](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2013/related/acts/20), signed into law by Republican Gov. Scott Walker.

After seven years in the minority party, Mr. Mason decided to run for Racine mayor instead. “I’d like to try governing,” he says.
