- Summary: Designers often struggle to work with complex systems like governance because they focus too much on visible projects and not enough on the underlying context. To create real change, design must engage deeply with the "dark matter" of culture, policy, and organizations. This means using projects as strategic tools to influence bigger systems, not just isolated outcomes.
