- Summary: Designers often see themselves as leaders shaping culture and society, but this view is challenged by critics who say design can be controlling and erase important histories. The field faces a crisis as designers seek independence but risk losing touch with practical problem-solving. Some argue that design should focus less on abstract ideas and more on real-world impact and liberation.
