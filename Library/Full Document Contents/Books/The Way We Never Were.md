- Summary: People often romanticize the 1950s family but overlook that many women and children suffered poverty inside two-parent homes. Economic and political changes, not divorce or single parenthood alone, largely explain rising family poverty and inequality. Greater gender equality has improved options for women even as class divides make stable family life harder for less-educated groups.
