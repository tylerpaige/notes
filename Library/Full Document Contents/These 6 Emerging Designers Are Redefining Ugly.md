#### Katie Stout

The 28-year-old artist and designer [Katie Stout](http://www.katiestout.com/), based in Brooklyn’s Bedford-Stuyvesant, has dubbed her oeuvre “naïve pop,” which is apt, considering the inspirations for her chipper, animated furnishings: Dolly Parton, Raymour & Flanigan, Charlotte Perriand, bagels. With rugs that look like giant floppy hats thrown on the floor, intentionally droopy knit chairs and her Girl lamps, which evoke the female form in a way she terms “lumpy and imperfect,” her goal is to make subversive objects that are “feel-good” but “have self-awareness.” Many aren’t entirely functional, like the knit chairs, which are too soft to sit on.

Stout, whose work was part of the Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard’s installation at the 2014 Whitney Biennial, believes that design, of late, takes itself too seriously — a trend she consciously seeks to undermine, using trash and found objects, as well as common materials including paper pulp, resin and fibers. The idea is to create a “haphazardly utopian” vision. Her yen for unpretentious chaos, she says, was sparked by reading about the Dada movement following World War I, when senselessness made perfect sense. For her upcoming show at R & Company in TriBeCa in September, she plans a room jammed with pieces from her Girl collection, including rugs and a sofa. “I want it to be really full,” she says, “like a claustrophobic sleepover.”

#### Chris Wolston

The designer [Chris Wolston](http://www.chriswolston.com/) likes to travel, and he resists planning everything out. He prefers, as he puts it, to “snake through the unmapped material landscape, discovering new practices and following them to the source.” This translates to visiting remote areas where everyday objects are still handmade. There, he learns to adapt such traditional processes as sand-casting and brickmaking for his own pieces, which are often made with unconventional materials — none, it seems, too lo-fi for Wolston. His heavily decorative Fetish lights are fashioned from neon tubing and sand-cast glass flecked with shards of glass from the trash, and he employs molds made from sewn-together pieces of foam to cast the legs for giant mirror-polished aluminum puzzle-piece dining tables.

Wolston, 29, is based in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, but his furniture and objects are profoundly informed by his relationship to Colombia, where he did a Fulbright fellowship. He keeps a second studio in Medellín, on a mountainside just outside the city. He’s equally fascinated by traditional materials like terra-cotta — a central element in artifacts of South America’s pre-Columbian past — from which he creates deliberately well-thumbed ceramic seats, some with planters built in. Exuberant and brightly colored, their textures reference the errant fingerprints he’s noticed on buildings throughout Medellín, unintentional impressions made by brick-makers smoothing the wet clay in wooden molds. (He will show new ceramic pieces at Patrick Parrish gallery in New York in May.) Wolston’s attempt to “bring elements of the hand into finished products” is indicative of his approach, pushing back against “the aesthetic of mechanization.”

#### Misha Kahn

In an era dominated by sleek, meticulously planned minimalism, [Misha Kahn](http://www.mishakahn.com/)’s disheveled, spontaneous maximalism feels like a swift kick. With irregular surfaces and amorphous shapes, his richly layered pieces in unorthodox combinations (bronze and trash, cement cast into vinyl) are as cocky as Memphis, but rougher and less refined. A 12-foot-long mohair tapestry was inspired by the shape of Jell-O molds and is composed like a riverscape tableau; when the grasses from Swaziland he was using to make his enormous, cartoonish Scrappy cabinet grew too scarce due to drought, he mixed them with bits of garbage and colored sea glass, to masterful effect. “I think a lot of designers are really stubborn and feel like their job is to pursue their original idea to the end,” says Kahn, a proud supporter of the low-tech and the ad hoc. “I don’t see any merit in that.”

Born in Minnesota and now working in Brooklyn’s Bushwick neighborhood, Kahn, 27, has classified his aesthetic as “uncomfortable.” He is “always wondering if some level of visual chaos, a bit of frenzy and entanglement, can match our sort of spastic, chaotic minds and result in calmness.” In his studio, which he has described as a “weird, psychedelic jungle,” clear bins hold the makings of future projects, such as rubber bits of refuse warped by prolonged time in the ocean or plastic pellets cadged from the bag factory down the street. “Being surrounded by crap and clutter,” he says, “tells the story of your life.”

#### Anton Alvarez

Stockholm-based [Anton Alvarez](http://www.antonalvarez.com/) doesn’t merely create objects; he fabricates the tools behind them — the things that make the things. Last year, he unveiled a next-generation clay extruder that bears down with nearly three tons of force, squeezing out wobbly vases and sculptures like cake frosting. His enormous tubular thread-wrapping machine — it “sounds like a storm,” he notes — is capable of unspooling 10,000 meters a day of glue-coated Day-Glo string that wraps around anything that passes through it, binding pieces together to make benches, chairs or arches. “When I’m designing the machines I can be very free,” says the Swedish-Chilean designer on being the living master of a craft he seems to have invented.

Alvarez, who, in true Scandinavian style, strives to keep his work space virtually barren except for the machines and the materials for his current project, admits that having mechanical collaborators has its challenges: “In the beginning, the machine knows more about the process than I do,” he says. “The machine is almost controlling me.” One thing he never thinks about while he is engineering a new machine is whether there is an audience for the creations that emerge. To him, such practicalities kill the spirit. “If you try to reach a specific market, it shines through,” he says. “My work doesn’t look like I tried to make someone else happy.”

#### Chen Chen & Kai Williams

After graduating from the Pratt Institute, [Kai Williams](http://chen-williams.com/) and his design partner, [Chen Chen](http://chen-williams.com/) (above, right), began making frequent trips to the Queens neighborhood of Willets Point, a place that was pretty desolate until the incursion of a recent development project. They went to admire the improvised furniture in the auto body shops, anonymously made “with a MIG welder and a socket set,” Chen says. “These things might be considered ugly, but we are more concerned with something being interesting versus boring.”

Such are the unexpected places where Williams and Chen, both 32, have found inspiration. And certainly, the word boring could never be applied to the avant-garde objects that emerge from their studio in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Embedding bits and bobs in polished urethane composites and then smashing, molding and slicing them, the two have created a signature style both freewheeling and rigorous. The idea that first brought them attention was their Cold Cut coasters, made from a loaf of rolled, resin-coated fabric and detritus carved like deli meat; a couple of years later, they collaborated with Tai Ping to produce rugs adorned with coaster patterns. Enamored with castoff elements like rope, bone and sticks, the duo, who started their studio in 2011, stockpile debris. Recently, they discovered a bag of steel shot in one of the drawers of a welding table that Williams had bought secondhand. After mixing it with resin, creating a caviarlike substance, they made sconces. Asked to sum up their practice, Chen says, “If you had all the money and time in the world, you would make something the ‘right’ way. If you have little of both, what are the solutions you come up with?”
