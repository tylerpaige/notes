# Notes

[[Caroline Howe for MailOnline - Berlin was a hotbed of homosexuality and a mecca for transsexuals]]

***

* **An uninhibited urban gay sexual scene flourished in Berlin, Germany in the wake of World War One**
* **The science of ‘transsexuality’ was founded at the Institute of Sexual Science where the first male-to-female surgery was performed**
* **German scientists concluded that same-sex love was a natural, inborn characteristic and not merely the perversion of a ‘normal’ sexual tendency**
* **There were 30 separate homosexual periodicals**
* **Cross-dressers found dressmakers who tailored for large sizes and singles searching for gay love could place ads**
