[[Seth Fiegerman - How Yahoo derailed Tumblr]]

***

Marissa Mayer was running late. This time, it wasn’t for a dinner with skeptical advertisers nor a conference call with her inner circle of Yahoo executives. She was late for a rare meeting with much of the team at Tumblr, nearly two years after acquiring the startup for $1.1 billion. The biggest acquisition of Mayer’s tenure as Yahoo CEO, Tumblr was supposed to revive Yahoo by broadening its audience and bolstering its long declining advertising business. In a Tumblr post announcing the deal (complete with a flashing GIF urging people to “keep calm”), Mayer famously promised “not to screw it up” for users. She tried to make good on that pledge by staying mostly hands off for the first year. By early 2015, however, Tumblr was at risk of being dragged down by Mayer and Yahoo. That January, Mayer broke the clear barrier between the companies by merging Tumblr’s ad sales team with Yahoo’s and putting them under a new executive who insiders say had little experience with Tumblr and even less rapport with its core employees. Soon after, Tumblr’s ad sales department was on the verge of a mass exodus. The sales turmoil came at the worst possible time. Tumblr was fighting to hit a $100 million sales goal set very publicly by Mayer -- a lofty target that surprised members of the media almost as much as it surprised employees at Tumblr. "WTF is that based on?" an employee remembers thinking when it became public. “That was Marissa just picking a number,” says a former Yahoo executive. (Yahoo declined to comment about revenue matters on the record, but a source close to the company disputed this claim.) The pressure and frustration bled into other departments leading up to Mayer's big meeting with the team, via video conference. One Yahoo source played it off as a routine meet-and-greet to kick off the new year. Numerous Tumblr employees characterized it as a much-needed pep talk from the distant executive shaking up their company. “The troops were restless,” says one former Tumblr employee who was in attendance that day. David Karp, the 20-something wunderkind who founded Tumblr and got rich selling it to Mayer, sat waiting for his boss to appear on a big screen behind him for a Q&A. Karp, smart and eternally optimistic, but with little experience to prepare him for working at a large corporation, looked “out of his element,” according to another employee there. On a different screen, Karp pulled up a video of a yule log to accompany the “fireside chat.” When Mayer showed up 20-30 minutes late, Karp and the audience listened as she talked about her time at Google, the thinking behind the ad sales transition and her intention to help Tumblr grow. Concerns went mostly unaired. One engineer made a GIF of Karp fiddling with his phone while Mayer talked on the screen overhead. He was Photoshopped to be eating while she talked. “It really fell pretty flat,” one employee said of Mayer’s appearance. “It was too little, too late and off base,” says another. Trouble dot Tumblr dot com Tumblr launched in 2007 to make it easier for people to write, share and discover blogs about anything. Literally anything. You want to post pictures of hungover owls, or judge people for taking selfies at funerals, or get all existential looking at Garfield comics without Garfield present? Knock yourself out. Tumblr built strong communities, launched Internet memes, led to countless book deals and helped shape the culture, online and offline. It remains an incredibly vibrant network with hundreds of millions of accounts spanning the full breadth of human interests, from powerful cultural commentary on women in Hollywood to raw teen shoplifting stories to discussions around the Black Lives Matter movement. There was also that thing about the color of The Dress. But the team behind Tumblr was derailed for a year by mass staff departures, internal politics with its parent company, Mayer's questionable executive appointments and a flawed attempt to integrate Tumblr's ad sales team with Yahoo’s, according to interviews with a dozen current and former employees from Tumblr and Yahoo as well as conversations with media buyers, analysts and peers in the industry, many of whom requested anonymity citing sensitive personal relationships with the company. Some on the Yahoo side argue Mayer gave Tumblr and Karp too much freedom for too long after the acquisition considering the social network’s poor track record making money, and then ultimately put the wrong people in charge of the team and pushed too hard. Those on the Tumblr side, unsurprisingly, mostly agree on the latter points. Top Yahoo executives clashed with Tumblr, or just flat out confused employees. On one occasion, an executive overseeing Karp and his division perplexed employees by saying he thought Tumblr had the potential to "create the next generation PDF," according to multiple sources. At other times, a top Yahoo sales exec spoke down to Tumblr’s advertising team and pushed aside a beloved leader, according to multiple employees. Tumblr staffers fled by the dozens, cutting into the company’s momentum and morale. Yahoo tried to make things right a year later by separating the ad teams again, but the damage was done. Tumblr has fallen out of the top 100 list of free iOS apps in the U.S. as of the beginning of June, according to data from AppAnnie, an app analytics service. Research firm eMarketer projects that “the gap [in users] between Tumblr and its competitors will widen through 2020.” In short, Tumblr is no longer the hot new thing for consumers -- or marketers. Kyle Bunch, a longtime Tumblr user and head of social at ad agency R/GA, says “the rise of Snapchat” has “forced Tumblr down the priority ladder” for brands. "With so many different platforms and new things emerging and clients coming to us asking, 'How do I do Snapchat better?' or 'Should I be thinking about Medium?' Tumblr has got to find its sweet spot and I just don’t know that it totally has a clear one," he says. In the absence of major new product features, younger services like Medium and Giphy are also eating away at it. One former Tumblr employee called it shameful that Giphy has surged to a $300 million valuation when Tumblr was once synonymous with GIFs. For that reason, as well as the internal politics and departures, Tumblr has still not hit that ambitious $100 million annual sales goal set in 2014, according to sources at the company. Tumblr has gone from being one of the top 10 most downloaded free iOS apps at the time of the acquisition to barely cracking the top 100. Tumblr declined to disclose its revenue growth or make anyone available to comment on the record for this article. A spokesperson for Tumblr noted that its mobile monthly active users have grown 35% year-over-year and daily time spent per user is up too. The spokesperson also highlighted hiring on the sales team and continued development of new advertising and consumer products to keep Tumblr competitive. These efforts to recover the momentum Tumblr lost in 2015 are taking place under the shadow of more difficult news from its parent company. Yahoo has said it may have to write-down the entire goodwill value of Tumblr, as it misses revenue targets and as similar publicly-traded social media companies not named Facebook are languishing. If that’s not enough, the much-rumored Yahoo sale is top of mind, thanks in no small part to Yahoo e-mailing staff about what happens to their severance packages if Yahoo gets sold. “It probably hurts the team to see stuff like that and freaks people out,” Matthew Bischoff, a former product manager at Tumblr who left in late 2015, says about the writedown and sale rumors. Another person close to Tumblr adds, “It is still a wonderful place to work -- if you are happy being heads down and not thinking about implications of Yahoo’s sale.” In a statement, a spokesperson for Yahoo said Tumblr remains an "integral part" of the "Yahoo family" and business. "Since the acquisition in 2013, we continue to work closely to align our strategies, build the best platform for Tumblr’s passionate community, and drive value for advertisers." Yet, several Tumblr staffers we spoke with are quietly fantasizing about the social network getting spun off if Yahoo is sold as expected, however unlikely that spinoff scenario may be. The most popular rumor is that Karp would buy back Tumblr -- though no one knows if he can afford it -- to save his company from the grips of Yahoo, or whichever new owner comes along next. Tumblr’s stumbles under Yahoo may go down as a cautionary tale, both for the perils of a large corporation buying a hot startup and for Silicon Valley’s belief that any social network reaching hundreds of millions of people will inevitably generate boatloads of cash one day. Tumblr was slow to monetize before it was acquired, struggled to grow revenue enough to meet its new parent company's expectations in the first year and struggled even more to keep up with ambitious goals when Yahoo began to meddle. The massive Tumblr acquisition may also come to highlight Mayer’s broader management missteps in making flashy bets, trusting deputies with limited knowledge of a product to oversee it and some mix of arrogance or denial in failing to quickly right those wrongs when necessary. “It’s such a black eye,” says one former Yahoo executive. “It didn’t have to be this way.” The billion-dollar bet Tumblr was billed as the linchpin for a new and improved Yahoo, or at the very least a much-needed “hip replacement” for the aging Internet giant. Tumblr was everything Yahoo wasn’t: Trendy, influencing pop culture, coveted by millennials, brands and celebrities, a place for passionate communities. And it was growing fast. “There were synergies that were very apparent to all of us, especially since they just had a younger, cooler audience and the Yahoo user base is dying,” says one former Yahoo employee. “We were like, ‘Great!’” “The combination of Tumblr+Yahoo! could grow Yahoo!’s audience by 50% to more than a billion monthly visitors,” Mayer explained in a Tumblr post announcing the acquisition. “The two companies will also work together to create advertising opportunities.” Sure, Yahoo had tried billion-dollar acquisitions in the past (remember GeoCities?), but this was different. This was Marissa Mayer, the powerful and brilliant Google executive, early in her tenure as Yahoo CEO and using her star power (along with Yahoo’s sizable checkbook) to bring one of New York’s most valuable startups into the purple mothership to help find a new audience and be cool again. Few private tech companies were as beloved around the world as Tumblr. Teenagers in Brazil cried -- genuinely cried -- in 2011 when they got to meet a few random employees from the team behind the site. The reason: Tumblr helped people form powerful connections to others with similar life experiences. As Stacy Lambe, one of the brains behind the viral Tumblr account Texts From Hillary, recalls by e-mail, “I met my first boyfriend — after coming out — through a group of Tumblr gays that I eventually met in real life.” That fondness for Tumblr extended to members of the marketing community focused on new media. “Everyone looked to it as the holy grail,” says George Bennett, group strategy director at Droga5, which does advertising work for many Fortune 100 companies. “If you can crack the secret sauce of what makes content on Tumblr go viral, then as a brand we’re on to something important.” Tumblr, founded in 2007 by then 21-year-old David Karp in his mom's apartment, was the hottest thing on the Internet and the team knew it. "A lot of the rhetoric in the early days was, ‘We’re on to something big. There's no reason why something like this couldn’t be on the scale of a Twitter,'" says Jared Hecht, an early employee and now CEO of Fundera. So when Karp asked all Tumblr employees to come in to their modern New York office early on a Monday morning in May and announced the sale to Yahoo, the reactions were mixed. Some younger employees didn’t know what Yahoo was (“They’re your weather app,” one manager told his team.) Some knew the name, but they were hoping to be bought by a trendier tech company or keep growing on their own. Some worried about the future. And some, including Karp, respected Mayer’s background, thought they could help Yahoo and help themselves -- and, of course, help themselves to Yahoo’s money. Karp, then 26, reportedly received about $250 million from the deal. A few early employees like ex-CTO Marco Arment are said to have pocketed millions. The rest made thousands, or nothing at all because they hadn’t vested. “I certainly didn’t make never-have-to-work-again money, but it was more than fair to me,” says Mark Coatney, Tumblr’s former media director. “[It was] a little bit of money, but for god’s sake, I don’t think it’s enough to buy a house in New York City.” Less discussed by the team that day was the problem that had always plagued the company: How Tumblr would make money. Karp, a coder at heart, is described by colleagues as “openly hostile” to traditional advertising. He publicly pushed back against the traditional online advertising of “little blue links” and waited years to build up a robust sales team. When they did start rolling out ads, Tumblr provided marketers with limited data and limited reach (the ads were focused on the much smaller pool of active, logged-in users). Traditional marketers, for their part, faced a steep learning curve (GIFs, anyone?) and were also skittish about some of the raunchier user-generated content on Tumblr. As Tumblr put off a real monetization plan for years, it ended up bleeding money. At the time of its sale, Tumblr had just $16 million in cash left in the bank, according to a public filing. It had spent down more than $100 million of its venture funding. That, as much as anything else, may have pushed Karp to sell. "This was an unbelievable opportunity to shortcut a lot of the very hard things that we're about to be going through," Karp said in one interview right after the acquisition, referring to the need to grow its business through advertising. "Monetization was always this looming thing in the back of peoples' minds," Hecht recalls. "One of the questions that people were always somewhat struggling with is when is the time to prioritize these features?" Now it was Yahoo’s struggle, too. “It wasn’t a business that had a clear path to revenues. It was a very problematic acquisition,” says Brian Wieser, an analyst who tracks Yahoo for Pivotal Research Group. But Mayer had the wind at her back, thanks largely to Wall Street’s fixation on Yahoo’s large stake in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant nearing what would go down as the largest public offering in history. “I think people were willing to give her the benefit of the doubt,” Wieser adds. Tumblr was across the country from Yahoo’s Sunnyvale, California headquarters. They had the option to tune in remotely to Yahoo's weekly all-hands meetings on Fridays and certain members of Tumblr's leadership team did have meetings with Mayer. But Mayer and her lieutenants largely kept a distance, perhaps to a fault. Mayer, according to some close to her, emulated the church-and-state model she’d seen as a longtime executive at Google when the company acquired YouTube. Likewise, Tumblr's team was weary of too much interference. Even Yahoo employees genuinely interested in joining Tumblr were initially given the cold shoulder. The promised “independence” couldn’t last forever, though. The first rumblings of a collision between the companies came at the beginning of 2014 when Yahoo unveiled a suite of new “digital magazines,” powered by Tumblr, but lacking most of Tumblr’s usual built-in social functionality. The Tumblr and Yahoo ad sales teams began selling joint packages together, bristling against each other in the process. Yet, some members of the youthful, ambitious Tumblr team still thought they would end up running and rejuvenating Yahoo sales one day. They were wrong. In October, 2014, with the Alibaba IPO done and investors once again fixated on Yahoo’s steadily declining sales business, Mayer made two big decisions that would shape the future of Tumblr. First she announced Tumblr would hit $100 million in revenue by 2015, in a clear nod to Wall Street’s appetite for revenue growth. Then Yahoo announced the hire of Amazon advertising executive Lisa Utzschneider to turn around its sales business, including Tumblr’s. Even longtime associates who admire her characterize Utzschneider as an executive known for ruffling feathers and thriving in Amazon's incredibly intense numbers-driven culture. "She's the kind to take no prisoners, not sugar coat, get to the heart of the issue and get it solved," says David Cohen, North America president of Magna Global who has known her for 15 years. "I like that." Once independent Tumblr employees on the receiving end of that more aggressive management style were stunned. Utzschneider pushed for control of Tumblr’s sales division, according to multiple sources. “She spoke down to everyone” on Tumblr’s ad team, according to an employee, and effectively shoved aside Lee Brown, the Tumblr sales exec popular among the team. Brown decamped to BuzzFeed in February, with others from his team following in tow. “It was this political coup and people were like what the fuck just happened? It led to everyone being disenchanted and a year of politics,” says a former Yahoo executive. Worse still, the Yahoo sales team was less familiar with Tumblr's DNA and how to sell it to marketers. "Even at its hottest, Tumblr wasn’t the easiest sell for advertisers. At first it was because of content-safety concerns. Then it was because the ad products were limited,” says Ben Winkler, chief investment officer at OMD, an ad agency. “Finally, it was because the ad sales team switched over to Yahoo, who simply did not have the expertise of the previous, native group of Tumblr reps." Inside Tumblr, the team stared at a slide each week showing a green progress bar toward the $100 million sales goal against a blue Tumblr background. “It was tracking like it was going to happen,” says Bischoff, the former product manager, “and then the sales transition happened and that just derailed it.” Two months after Brown left and the exodus began, Mayer re-organized Yahoo's top leadership and put Karp, who had reported to her directly until then, underneath Simon Khalaf, the executive who founded Flurry, an advertising company bought by Yahoo a year after Tumblr. Khalaf fumbled communications with the team at times, causing some to wonder if he fully understood the platform he was tasked with overseeing. “One time he came to an all-team meeting and told us we were going to be the new PDF,” recalls one former employee. “It didn’t make any sense. We’d walk away scratching our heads.” A source close to Yahoo says Khalaf was trying to compliment Tumblr's potential on mobile. Earlier this year, Yahoo reversed the ill-fated decision to integrate the two sales teams. The company has re-staffed its sales team and is pushing out new ad products. At a recent all-hands meeting, Karp received a round of applause after talking up a mysterious big new project, according to a current employee. Tumblr is trying to move forward after its lost year, but it faces new competition, the fresh wound of Yahoo’s $240 million Tumblr writedown disclosed in February and the uncertainty of who will be its owner next month, or the month after that -- and what that person or company will want from it. Many Tumblr insiders hope it will be David Karp again. In all likelihood it will be Verizon or AT&T. Some we spoke with would settle for anyone but Yahoo. As one employee rooting for a Yahoo sale put it, “We’ve already seen what this is, let some other media company come in and make smarter decisions.”
