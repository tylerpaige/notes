Summary: President-elect Donald Trump claims that his election is boosting job creation, but many companies, like Sprint, are simply taking advantage of his rhetoric for their own profit. The jobs Sprint announced are not new but part of earlier commitments made before Trump took office. This situation raises concerns about crony capitalism and its potential negative impact on the economy and job losses in the telecom industry.

President-elect Donald Trump would like everybody to believe that his election is energizing the economy by forcing businesses to create thousands of jobs in the United States. And companies like Sprint seem perfectly happy to go along with this fiction because they know they can profit handsomely by cozying up to Mr. Trump.

On Wednesday, [Mr. Trump said](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/28/us/politics/donald-trump-sprint-jobs.html?ref=business) Sprint’s top executive had told him the company would add 5,000 jobs [“because of what’s happening and the spirit and the hope.](https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-12-28/trump-says-billionaire-masa-son-adds-u-s-jobs-at-sprint-oneweb)” But it turns out that the jobs are part of a previous commitment by Sprint’s parent company, SoftBank, whose [chief executive said](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/business/dealbook/donald-trump-mayayoshi-son-softbank.html) at Trump Tower in December that it would invest $50 billion and create 50,000 jobs in the United States. And even that promise was part of a $100 billion technology fund that SoftBank [announced in October](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/business/dealbook/softbank-and-saudi-arabia-partner-to-form-giant-investment-fund.html), before the election. In sum, Mr. Trump’s statement was hot air, just like his tweet in which he [thanked himself](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/813945096269860866) for an increase in a consumer confidence index last month.

The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS! Thanks Donald!

It’s easy to see why SoftBank and Sprint might want to help Mr. Trump take credit for creating jobs. SoftBank’s chief executive, Masayoshi Son, wants the Department of Justice’s antitrust division and the Federal Communications Commission to allow a merger between Sprint and T-Mobile. [In 2014](https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/08/05/sprint-and-softbank-said-to-abandon-bid-for-t-mobile-us/) regulators appointed by President Obama made clear to Mr. Son that they would not approve such a transaction because it would cut the number of national wireless companies to three, from four, greatly [reducing competition](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/15/opinion/keeping-the-wireless-business-competitive.html) in a concentrated industry. Mr. Son sees a new opening for his deal in Mr. Trump, who has surrounded himself with people who have sided with [large telecommunications companies](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/opinion/expect-a-cozy-trump-telecom-alliance.html) in regulatory debates and have argued against tough antitrust enforcement.

This is crony capitalism, with potentially devastating consequences. If Mr. Trump appoints people to the antitrust division and the F.C.C. who are willing to wave through a Sprint/T-Mobile merger, he will do lasting damage to the economy that far outweighs any benefit from 5,000 jobs, jobs that might have been created even without the merger. Individuals and businesses will find wireless service costs a lot more when they have only Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile/Sprint to choose from.

In addition, a combined Sprint and T-Mobile would inevitably cut thousands of jobs as executives merge the companies’ networks, stores, billing systems, customer service departments and so on. That has happened time and again after big telecom deals. When AT&T was acquiring BellSouth in 2006, [executives said](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/11684785/ns/business-us_business/t/job-cuts-planned-after-att-bellsouth-deal/#.WGU7tbYrKV4) they expected to cut 10,000 jobs after the deal closed [in December of that year](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/30/business/30tele.html). Since then AT&T has also [acquired DirecTV](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/20/opinion/what-atts-offer-might-mean.html). At the end of September, AT&T [employed 273,000 people](https://www.att.com/Common/about_us/pdf/att_btn.pdf) around the world, [down from 309,000 in 2007](https://www.att.com/Investor/ATT_Annual/2007/downloads/07_ATTar_FullFinalAR.pdf).

It has become abundantly clear that Mr. Trump is easily distracted by shiny objects, especially if they reflect back on him. He’s more interested in boasting about how he personally saved [a thousand jobs](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/opinion/carrier-jobs-saved-by-government.html) [at Carrier](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/01/business/economy/trump-carrier-pence-jobs.html?_r=0), say, than in policy details that could make a difference in the lives of tens of millions of workers. Never mind that Carrier is only keeping about 800 jobs and that its [chief executive said](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/12/05/cnbc-transcript-united-technologies-chairman-ceo-greg-hayes-on-cnbcs-mad-money-w-jim-cramer-today.html) that the company would get rid of some of those anyway through automation. This should greatly worry Americans, especially people who are counting on Mr. Trump to revive the economy and help the middle class.
