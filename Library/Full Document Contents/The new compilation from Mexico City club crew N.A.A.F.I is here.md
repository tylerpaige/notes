N.A.A.F.I, the club music crew based out of Mexico City, has dropped a new compilation.

'Pirata 3' is the latest instalment in the squad's 'Pirata' series, which serves up party-starting bootlegs, edits and unofficial remixes from N.A.A.F.I friends and family.

The fruits of last year's comp found their way into the sets of club DJs across the world and the third edition is sure to do the same kind of damage. The team affectionately refer to the tracks collected on the newest 'Pirata' as "palazos", which is Spanish for "hit with a stick". So, in the words of co-founder Mexican Jihad, you should prepare for "club bangers that hit you hard".

These bangers come from fellow N.A.A.F.I founders Lao and Paul Marmota as well as affiliates Lechuga Zafiro, Imaabs, Zakmatic, Omaar, Tayhana, Zutzut and Wasted Fates. Other contributions come from Pininga, Moro, Santa Muerte, DJ Bekman, Spaceseeds and Traxmatik. The compilation is full of fire, basically.

N.A.A.F.I pushes the club music coming out of South America via its label, parties and radio show and 'Pirata 3' features tracks sent from across Mexico as well as Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and North America. The series started as a way of sharing the bootlegs the crew were making and swapping among themselves – once the tracks had been fully hammered by N.A.A.F.I's core unit, of course. It's also emblematic of the crew's DIY approach.

"Informal economies are a fundamental expression of the developing world," says Mexican Jihad. "In Mexico music piracy is bigger than any label or music industry. It's a whole way to operate and relate to a market driven reality as individuals. Being pirata is very punk."

You can download 'Pirata 3' direct from the N.A.A.F.I server [here](http://naafi.mx/uploads/PIRATA%203.zip) or stream/DL via [Hulkshare](https://www.hulkshare.com/playlist/131798).

Look out for the Smirnoff Sound Collective’s next documentary 'Tribes: N.A.A.F.I.' which premieres on Mexican Independence Day (September 16). The documentary focuses on the Mexico City-based music collective and on celebrating how N.A.A.F.I. has created a new cultural identity in electronic music by embracing diversity and the different cultural experiences of individuals from around the world.
