[[Eli Schiff - Uber’s Undoing Part II: Local vs. Global]]

To anyone but a designer, it’s obvious that most modern designs can’t stand on their own aesthetic merit. Thus the primary service designers offer is not in ‘mere surface concerns,’ otherwise known as aesthetics, but in the narratives they tell to justify visual mediocrity.

This can be seen in the grueling eighteen-month period in which Kalanick and the design team came up with a mission for the 2016 rebrand. That process resulted in what they dubbed Uber’s Five Pillars: “Uber aspires to be: grounded, populist, inspiring, highly evolved, and elevated.” Of the five, the most striking is the inclusion of “populist.”

But by the time of the launch, the lodestar, “populist,” had taken on quite a different tenor. This discrepancy would seem strange, if it hadn’t been for the publication of how the team shifted process mid-redesign. As I documented in previous coverage,

>  Despite making progress on the logo and icon, the team still found themselves at a standstill due to Kalanick’s shifting sensibilities. According to Wired, “It felt wrong for Uber’s global and local brands to revolve around the color preferences of a rich, white guy in California—even if that rich, white guy in California is the CEO. “We walked out and we were like, this is crazy—we’re designing a brand for Travis,” says Amin.”

Uber quickly rectified this error. By the time their [2016 press release](https://www.uber.com/newsroom/celebrating-cities-a-new-look-and-feel-for-uber-7) was unveiled, they had changed their slogan dramatically:

>  The number one cultural value at Uber is “Celebrate cities.” For us, that means doing everything we can to make people around the world feel like we were born in the place they call home.
> 
>  

It was in this spirit that the rebrand was christened, “Celebrating Cities: A New Look and Feel for Uber.” So what then does Celebrating Cities look like?

Picture a brand redesign from the imagination of a boomer couple traipsing around the developing world—the safe parts of course—collecting trinkets and patterned quilts in an effort to out-do their retiree friends back home. In essence, the ideology of the 2016 rebrand was cosmopolitan boomerism.

![](https://elischiff.com/images/2018-10-10-Local-research@2x.webp)Extensive local research was conducted for the 2016 rebrand.
Kalanick left no stone unturned in capturing the local flavors of the dozens of markets Uber served. From the 2016 [guidelines](https://brand.uber.com/#our-new-look):

>  When we start designing for a specific market, we look at the culture holistically—art, architecture, tradition, old and new fashion, textiles, the environment—to create color palettes and patterns that are both fresh and relevant. We’re launching with 65 local color palettes and patterns, representing countries in which Uber operates. These colors and patterns are authentic expressions of the real world’s diversity, and they afford flexibility in our communications…But this is just the start. Every city has its own character and our long term goal is to have unique designs for cities as well as countries. This will mean adding hundreds more color palettes and patterns over time.

![](https://elischiff.com/images/2018-10-10-484-unique-hues@2x.webp)In case you thought 65 colors weren’t enough, Uber offered 484 unique hues to select from.
Having too few colors was a dangerous prospect, so the team didn’t settle:

>  Our limited color palette didn’t allow us to differentiate designs by audiences…Our color spectrum allows unique combinations that can speak to specific locations, holidays, and partnerships—inspired by the colors of the physical world, we created a broad spectrum: 22 different colors and 22 values, 484 unique hues in total.

In the early months of 2016, we occupied a different semantic landscape than we do today. At the time, it seemed perfectly acceptable to “Celebrate Cities,” and celebrate them specifically for their differences:

>  The Mumbai market is very different than, say, the market in Lagos. Uber’s rebrand, says Kalanick, is about helping every person in its ecosystem—riders, partners, and employees—grok the company’s culture and ambitions.
> 
>  

Uber’s brand guide [reiterated](https://brand.uber.com/#our-new-look) this message:

>  We want people around the world to feel like Uber was born in their city, so a conventional brand system simply won’t work. You can’t have the same look and feel in Chengdu as you do in Charleston and expect to be embraced by both cultures…

It was a different time, as is demonstrated by the comments of Uber Nigeria’s general manager, Ebi Atawodi, as she explained their research process to Wired,
