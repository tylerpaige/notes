For most of America, news of the terrible mass shooting in Orlando, Florida, is causing shock, horror, and sorrow. But for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, the deaths of 50 of his fellow citizens was an opportunity to gaze upon his own reflection and engage in some vigorous rhetorical masturbation.

After noting there’d been a “really bad shooting in Orlando”—and then immediately returning to more pressing matters, like things Hilary Clinton had said about him—Trump made another attempt to acknowledge the tragedy:

 
> Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?

It was almost as though he had an answer in mind. Although a quick survey of the replies to his tweet yield a “Delete your account,” pointed questions about the Republican Party and gun control, and the usual garbage fire of gleefully racist and anti-Semitic memes from Trump supporters, apparently Donald saw something different. In his next tweet, he thanked his supporters for all the congratulations he was getting on the occasion of a mass murder in Florida.

 
> Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!

It’s another wonderful day for the public face of the Republican Party, Donald J. Trump. Congratulations, Donald!
