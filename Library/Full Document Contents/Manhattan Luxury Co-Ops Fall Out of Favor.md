[[Oshrat Carmiel - Manhattan Luxury Co-Ops Fall Out of Favor]]

***

The luxury Manhattan co-op, a longtime sign of real estate prestige and exclusivity in New York, may be losing its appeal. Blame a glut of newly built high-end condos.

Contracts for co-op apartments priced at $4 million or more fell 25 percent this year from 2015, as buyers with means opted for newer homes with more amenities and fewer restrictive rules, according to a [report](http://www.olshan.com/marketreport.php "Olshan Realty 2016 Year-End Luxury Report") published by luxury brokerage Olshan Realty Inc. It was the biggest annual decline since the firm started tracking luxury co-op contracts a decade ago.
