I [asked](https://twitter.com/dburka/status/936083852845572096) a whole bunch of designers what books, which weren’t specifically about digital or graphic design, inspired them. And, wow I got a ton of great responses. Here are twelve of the most popular recommendations:

#### [1. The Death and Life of Great American Cities](https://www.amazon.com/Death-Life-Great-American-Cities/dp/067974195X) by Jane Jacobs

The classic book about city planning in a humane way. Still as relevant as when it was first published in the early 1960s.

#### [2. The Timeless Way of Building](https://www.amazon.com/Timeless-Way-Building-Christopher-Alexander/dp/0195024028) by Christopher Alexander

“A new theory of architecture, building, and planning which has at its core that age-old process by which the people of a society have always pulled the order of their world from their own being.” — Amazon

#### [4. The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/1930824130) by Edward Tufte
