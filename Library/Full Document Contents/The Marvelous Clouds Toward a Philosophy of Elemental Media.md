Summary: The book explores how natural elements like earth, air, fire, and water serve as fundamental media shaping human life and culture. It argues that media go beyond human tools and include the natural world, linking technology, nature, and philosophy. The author calls for a broader view of media studies that embraces science, theology, and the environment.
