“Phoning it in” means to do something with very little effort or enthusiasm. The idiom seems oddly prescient now, given that it dates back to a time before the internet. (If you’re curious, further details are a mere Google away.) Is humanity now phoning in life? These photographs, taken in New York City late last month, show clearly what most people know: We are much more likely to be looking at our digital slabs than at our fellow human beings.

For the socially anxious, this may be a blessing in disguise. It’s no longer considered rude to avert your gaze and stare down mutely at a glowing screen in public. It’s the new eye contact. But there’s a catch. A 2018 study from The Journal of Family Medicine and Primary Care reported that the number of selfie-related deaths from 2011 to 2017 was 259. Perhaps those people were living life to the fullest. It’s not out of the question. Or maybe other people could have intervened had they, too, not been immersed in the scroll.

Civilization IRL — the one we live in when we are not looking at our phones — feels as if it is at an impasse between advancement and decay. Which one will prove triumphant? The answer might not be in the cloud.
