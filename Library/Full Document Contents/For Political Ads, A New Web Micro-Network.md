It was just past 10 a.m. on a Saturday in mid-October when Dan Beckmann pulled his rented SUV into the gravelly parking lot of Jack Cobb & Son, a barbecue joint in Farmville, N.C. He had only two days to shoot 10 video segments on barbecue that will run on the website of WTVD, the ABC affiliate in Durham. The rush had nothing to do with the station’s interest in smoked meat. Beckmann’s company, Programming Corporation of America (PCA), had sold advertising on the barbecue videos to a super-PAC, with a promise they’d be viewed 500,000 times before Election Day.
