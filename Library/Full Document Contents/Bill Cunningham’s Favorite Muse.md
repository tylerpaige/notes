Photograph from the New-York Historical Society, Gift of Bill Cunningham

Bill Cunningham, “Bowery Savings Bank (built circa 1920),” circa 1968-1976. Gelatin silver photograph.

One of my most sacred possessions is a copy of “Facades” given to me by the photographer Editta Sherman in 2013, the year she died, when she was a hundred years old. The book, a slim metallic-blue paperback, is one of the only photograph collections that [Bill Cunningham](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/16/man-on-the-street) ever published, a compendium to a Fashion Institute of Technology show of the “Facades Project,” in 1977. The project, which was entirely Cunningham’s vision, took eight years to complete and resulted in more than eighteen hundred photographs. This is the basic concept: Cunningham photographed Sherman, who was then in her sixties, in period clothing all over New York City. They would shoot day and night, in rain and snow. They trespassed, climbed fences, squatted on strange stoops. Cunningham had the idea for this grand adventure in 1968, when he began collecting vintage women’s clothing. He started to see how far back he could go in time, what glittering material he could rustle up from the past. He found a mob cap from the seventeen-seventies, an original Courrèges suit, flapper bonnets and chinchilla coats. He collected eyelet parasols and velvet opera gloves, springy bustles and crinoline bloomers. He acquired his most expensive piece, a two-hundred-dollar dress from 1837, by offering the store owner an antique Chinese table as a barter. He scoured estate sales and auctions, attics and thrift shops. But the clothes were only half of the idea. What Cunningham wanted most was to juxtapose the historical fashions against New York itself, bringing out contrasts and comparisons between the lines of the corsets and the lines of the architecture. He wanted to create a living collage that was also a valentine to the built environment. He wanted to show that New York and the fashion world have a lot going on underneath their façades. There is a symbiotic, erotic connection.

In order to make the sartorial past come alive amid brick walls and brownstones, Cunningham had to pick a model who seemed to exist out of time, who floated over the city as if she had always been there. He did not have to look far to find this muse. Cunningham lived down the hall from Sherman in Carnegie Hall for more than four decades—anyone who has seen “Bill Cunningham New York” remembers her star turn in the documentary, when she shows off her glamour shots of Tilda Swinton, changes boas and berets, and reminisces about dancing “The Dying Swan” at Warhol’s Factory—and they remained steadfast friends and neighbors until she died. After the two were forced to leave Carnegie Hall (they were the last remaining bohemian tenants squatting in the building’s residences), they moved together to another building, on Central Park South. (Sherman lived on the seventh floor of the new building; Cunningham lived a few floors higher.) Cunningham still came to visit Sherman every week, bringing her coffee and pastries. When I visited her—ostensibly for a story, but also because I love eccentric New York women so much that I would pay to spend afternoons in their closets—she talked about Cunningham with the affection that we reserve only for true loved ones. “Bill loved this mink.” “Bill draped me in this brocade.” “Bill loved my hair underneath this veil.” “Bill thought I should wear a turban with a giant jewel!” She posed for me as she mentioned his name, as if he were in the room and ready to shoot her. She acted a bit like Norma Desmond ready for her closeup, but it was more celebratory than bathetic; her Mr. DeMille lived right upstairs, and he truly did help to make her a star.

When I thumb through “Facades,” now that both Sherman and Cunningham are gone, what strikes me most deeply is how much fun the two seemed to have together. Here’s Sherman giving a flamenco-like flourish on the steps of a Georgian row house in a hat festooned with peacock feathers. Here’s Sherman strutting down lower Broadway with the hauteur of a society grande dame, in a frothy summer dress made of sheer lace. Here’s Sherman sprinting across Fifty-ninth Street in a drop-waist gown and felt cloche, just out of focus enough to show her speed. She is smiling with her whole face, looking directly at the camera, directly at Cunningham. Here’s Sherman, on a rooftop near the Knights of Pythias temple, in the West Seventies, her hair slicked back into a masculine sheen; she wears heavy eyeliner and holds a long cigarette holder. Her eyes are closed, her hand is on her hip in a jaunty, rebellious gesture. She looks like a Weimar-era clown, and also perfectly at peace. She looks like a skyscraper. There is joy in every frame of the book. This is a reflection of the joy that Cunningham and Sherman clearly felt running around the city together (he scouted all the locations for “Facades,” as he did with every other shot he ever took, on his bicycle), and also of the exuberance of the city itself.

A lot has been written—and will be written—about the democratic way in which [Bill Cunningham saw New Yorkers](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/bill-cunningham-saw-us-all). He saw them all as beautiful misfit children, from the downtown club kids covered in spangles and safety pins to the socialites preening at charity galas in gossamer bubbles of tulle. His camera was his eye, and he was always looking, never judging, just hoping to be excited by what he saw. He had an optimistic, unjaded lens. He got out of the way, sacrificing being known himself in order to devote his life to observing others; his smock and his bicycle made him a mercenary of the streets. He was a documentarian more than an élitist—he loved fashion as a playground for personal creativity, and therefore saw it without boundaries, rules, or limitations of taste. This is all true.

But when I heard that Cunningham had died, the first person I thought about was Sherman. I thought about how, when she was a woman zooming toward her seventies, and therefore toward societal invisibility, he saw her so thoroughly as to devote eight years of his life, and thousands of bicycle trips, to finding new ways to make her look beautiful. He shot her as a monument, in every corner of the city. I thought about what an act of love that was. Yes, Cunningham saw everyone, but in Sherman’s case he also made the extreme gesture of seeing and capturing her over and over, exposing aspects of who she really was with every frame, until he had created a prismatic artifact that was impossible to dismiss. He used his camera to show that there was as much vitality and character left in an aging woman as there was in the aging stonework of legendary New York buildings. He showed that there was deep bedrock to both, and also a mutable lightness.
