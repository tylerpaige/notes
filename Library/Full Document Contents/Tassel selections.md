[[docs.google.com - Tassel selections]]

***

It looks like saved a private Google Doc to Reader. Unfortunately, these private Google Docs cannot be parsed into Reader like other documents on the web. However, you can get this document into Reader two ways.

First, you can make it public.

Second, you can export it as an EPUB and upload to Reader. Here's how:

1. **Open the document** in Google Docs.
2. **Go to** `File > Download` and select `EPUB Publication (.epub)`.
3. **Save the file** to your device.
4. **Upload the EPUB** to Reader.

If the Google Doc is public and you're still getting this message, please report a parsing issue.
