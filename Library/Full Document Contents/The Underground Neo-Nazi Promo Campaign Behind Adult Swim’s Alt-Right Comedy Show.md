# Notes

[[Joseph Bernstein - The Underground Neo-Nazi Promo Campaign Behind Adult Swim’s Alt-Right Comedy Show]]

***

Last month, printers at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Antisemitic-Fliers-UCSC-Aug-17-2016.pdf) and [elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/adultswim/comments/50ff9j/heres_the_buzzfeed_article_on_world_peace_that/d73zha5) spontaneously disgorged [a single sheet of paper](http://imgur.com/ruHdfNd) bearing swastikas and [rows of black and white](http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/UCSC-Antisemitic-Flier-August-2016.pdf) text. Titled *Samiz.dat*, the printouts told the story of a man named Tyler, who in a near-future New York commits a mass murder in a synagogue. Fueled by a “pure hatred of niggers,” Tyler begins by killing “a single black in the temple” — whose presence is the result of a “kike slut” who believes in “race mixing propaganda” — then begins to shoot the rest of the “filthy Jew[s].”

At the end of the story, Tyler turns to...

> "...a teenaged Jewess that was quivering in fear. Tyler grabbed a nearby tefillin and began furiously beating her with the straps. After rejoicing in her cries of pain, he used the hot flash hider of his Saiga to penetrate her virgin cunt and sear her insides before he began to rape her. Tyler's last moments were spent raping all three orifices of the virgin Jewess before killing her and himself. "I love Jews! Jews rock!" were Tyler's last words. This atrocity happened as a result of MILLION DOLLAR EXTREME PRESENTS WORLD PEACE, Friday nights on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim."

Evidence strongly suggests the disturbing text is the work of Andrew “weev” Auernheimer, the notorious white nationalist hacker and troll who throughout the past year has made a sport of sending unwanted hate speech to thousands of unprotected public printers around the country. In March, [he took immediate credit](https://storify.com/weev/a-small-experiment-in) for printing, mostly using open printers at universities and colleges, some 30,000 flyers for the *Daily Stormer*, which describes itself as “The World's #1 Alt-Right and Pro-Genocide Website.” Between two large swastikas, the flyer exhorts white men to “join us in the struggle for global white supremacy.” Then, earlier in August, [Weev sent](https://storify.com/weev/why-i-am-getting-a-bowlcut) to thousands more printers the first issue of a “webzine” called *Samiz.dat* — for the underground protest literature in the Soviet Union — that advocated raping, torturing, and murdering the children of black people, Jews, and “federal agents.” On Twitter, Weev described *Samiz.dat* as “an underground ... magazine for racially aware authoritarians published only to every open printer on the Internet.” The hack has inspired imitators.

Indeed, these printouts have become so commonplace that they no longer spur coverage. What is surprising about the newest issue of *Samiz.dat*, however, is that it explicitly promotes a weekly television show on a major cable network owned by Time Warner. Corporate media tends not to be an object of affection amongst white supremacists. (“I know you fucking Jews control the fucking media,” reads a line from the document.)

But then, *World Peace* is far from a typical television show. As BuzzFeed News [reported last month](https://www.buzzfeed.com/josephbernstein/the-alt-right-has-its-own-comedy-tv-show-on-a-time-warner-ne), the members of Million Dollar Extreme (MDE), the sketch comedy troupe who created the show, are the preferred court jesters of the alt-right, the pro-Trump online movement that prizes offensive speech, believes white people in America are imperiled, and churns out memes at a metastatic pace. The alt-right is a leaderless movement that resists easy characterization; in fact, that is one of its defense mechanisms. [Weev described](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/) even a sympathetic report by Breitbart on the alt-right as "The tireless attempts of you Jews to smear us decent Nazis.” But his preoccupation with white identity and white nationhood, his adoption of hate speech as a principle, and his commitment to trolling make him an important figure within the movement regardless of his public statements.

Indeed, while *Samiz.dat* may have read simply as terrifying speculative fiction to the passersby who discovered it, the document is full of in-jokes that would only make sense to committed members of the alt-right.

Tyler, the mass murderer, is a reference to [a character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5Ub55qx2wQ) created by MDE frontman Sam Hyde. In the story printouts, Tyler commands his victims to post to social media blaming Hyde for the shooting; that’s a reference to [a series of hoaxes](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ishmaeldaro/sam-hyde-shooter-hoax?utm_term=.jtEvOnJ5r#.bplKmBxd8) in which members of 4chan publicly named Hyde as the perpetrator of a series of real mass shootings. And Tyler's last words, "Jews rock!", are the name of a skit in a recent episode of *World Peace*.

So what apparently caused Weev to devote an entire issue of his "webzine" to promoting *World Peace*?

Though Adult Swim has a history of [controversial guerrilla marketing](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/02/business/media/02guerilla.html?_r=0), the network said in a statement that it had no part in the creation or dissemination of the promotion.

Instead, Weev seems to have been prompted by a request from Sam Hyde. On Aug. 16, Hyde's Twitter account (which he previously told BuzzFeed News was managed by his "assistant") asked his followers to help promote *World Peace*:

> episode 103 and 104 (this friday and next) are super important. if you know any famous people, tell them any lie they need to hear 4 promo
> 
> 

Within four hours, Weev wrote to another alt-right account that he had "already finished the postscript" — a printer language — "and i'm waiting for the scan to finish." Then he posted a copy of the text of *Samiz.dat* to Pastebin.com. The UC Santa Cruz Police Department [reported flyers had been sent to networked campus printers](http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Antisemitic-Fliers-UCSC-Aug-17-2016.pdf) the following day.

Hyde is personally acquainted with Weev. The two accounts periodically interact on Twitter; Hyde (or his assistant) told Weev that he was ["planning on sending"](https://twitter.com/Night_0f_Fire/status/753342503714258944) him a review copy of the MDE book *How to Bomb the US Gov't*. On the Million Dollar Extreme subreddit — which Hyde, or his "assistant," moderates — [Weev bragged about the first issue](https://www.reddit.com/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/4vvb3z/tens_of_thousands_of_printers_delivered_fliers/) of *Samiz.dat*, which mentioned Hyde by name. [And in a Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/465fi5/i_am_andrew_weev_auernheimer_nationalist/d02rjc0), Weev said that he had met Hyde only once, but that Hyde was "an awesome dude" who had offered to help him make videos. Weev added that when they met he asked for "a fanboy jpeg," which may be the following image of the two heiling that periodically gets shared on [the MDE internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/milliondollarextreme/comments/3hkexu/sam_doing_nazi_shit_with_infamous_neonazi_hacker/):

Hyde responded to a BuzzFeed inquiry asking if he knew about the promotion ahead of time with a one word email: "nope." Hyde later followed up with an expression of affectionate condescension for the reporter.

Despite repeatedly taking credit for *Samiz.dat* online and initially agreeing over Twitter DM to answer questions about the fliers, Weev attributed the publications to his "assistant." He told BuzzFeed News that Hyde did not know about the publication ahead of time. When asked how he knew that, since his assistant was responsible for the publication, he responded, "Why would my assistant consult those disgusting race mixers from MDE about our plan to get the liberal media to attack them?"

But perhaps a more important question than the provenance of the letter is one about what it represents: Does a show that inspires neo-Nazi pamphleteering jibe with Time Warner's [avowed corporate values](http://www.timewarner.com/company/corporate-responsibility) of "freedom of expression, diversity of viewpoints and responsible content?"

Time Warner did not respond to a request for comment.
