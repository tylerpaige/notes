Summary: Released in 2007, Burial's album "Untrue" had a significant impact on the UK dance scene, leading to a turn towards introspective melancholy in electronic music. The influence of Burial's style can be seen in the work of other producers and bands, such as James Blake and The xx, who incorporated similar moody elements into their music. Burial's music has also been associated with the emotional tenor of the 21st century, characterized by a sense of vague gloom and hollowness. Since "Untrue," Burial has released smaller statements in the form of EPs, showcasing his unique and ever-changing sound. Despite his initial brief period of attention, Burial has maintained his anonymity and withdrawn from the public eye.

Its title rings out like an accusation. “Untrue” is a slightly old-fashioned way of describing someone—a lover, usually—who’s unfaithful. It could also be a simple assertion that something is a lie. But you might also say that “untruth” is a quintessential attribute of music itself. The word captures something about the insubstantiality of sound, its quality of dream or mirage: The way it conjures up tantalizing visions of a more perfect existence, out of reach and unattainable. Music can be a place where we hide from the harshness of the world as it really is.

Rarely interviewed, [Burial](https://pitchfork.com/artists/4806-burial/) has only once offered an explanation for the title of his second album, and a partial one. “It’s like when someone’s not acting like themselves,” he told Australian critic Anwen Crawford in 2007. “They’re off-key, something’s wrong, an atmosphere has entered the room.”

Titles are very important things in instrumental electronic music—surprisingly perhaps, given that the music is otherwise nonverbal. An inspired track or album title lightly guides the listener through the abstract sensations and emotions stirred up by the music. Burial is a maestro of titles. Some are jarringly concrete (“Dog Shelter,” “In McDonalds”), others are enigmatic (“Etched Headplate”), or poetic (“Shell of Light”). But perhaps his greatest feat of nomenclature is his own alias.

The name Burial pays homage to the reggae roots of dubstep, the genre to which he’s loosely affiliated, and the sound system tradition that informs UK rave culture. When rival systems compete in a sound-clash, they save their most devastating dubplate—sometimes called the “burial tune”—for the final stage of battle. That term migrated into the rave lexicon: The biggest anthem of 1994, jungle’s breakout year in the UK, was Leviticus’ “Burial,” while Gant’s “Sound Bwoy Burial” was an early UK garage classic. These layered ancestral echoes, rippling back across the decades—from the murky clubs and rowdy pirate radio stations of 1990s London all the way to Kingston, Jamaica, in the ’70s—is something that Burial consciously honors with the name he chose to hide behind.

But the name Burial sets in motion another set of associations, plugging into the somber side of post-punk. The moniker brings to my mind the cover of Joy Division’s *Closer*: a photograph, taken in an Italian cemetery, of a sculpted tableau of a dead man who could be Christ surrounded by mourners. That image was personally selected by the band’s singer, Ian Curtis, a few months before he committed suicide, as if he already knew he would end his life and become a rock martyr.

Reading about how Burial liked to test his tunes by driving around South London in the dead of night, to see if they had the quality of “distance” he sought, always reminded me of the tales of Joy Division producer Martin Hannett making similar psycho-geographic jaunts through the post-industrial zones of Manchester in the late ’70s, listening to contemporaries like PiL and Pere Ubu in his car. Both Hannett and Burial share an obsession with using reverb and near-subliminal sound effects, often taken from the real world, to conjure an atmosphere of eerie space.

Beyond the sonic resemblances and a shared aura of desolation, there are other parallels between Burial and Joy Division. Both released startling, out-of-nowhere debuts that introduced a revelatory sound that felt visual, making your ears gaze into the distance. Both followed those up with immaculate sequels that completed and perfected the initial statement. Neither released a third studio album—although in Burial’s case, that remains a (seemingly faint) possibility.

The post-punk connection helps to explain why Burial is the one dubstep artist that people who don’t follow dubstep, or even electronic dance music, have latched onto. His albums have been embraced by music fans whose preferred listening might be the Cure (a group whose early and gloomiest music Burial is said to adore) or Radiohead. It makes sense to slot Burial in that pale lineage of “young men [with] the weight on their shoulders,” to quote an Ian Curtis lyric—to see him as another of those sad-eyed “missing boys” who left “some signs” and is “now a legend,” to quote the Durutti Column’s tribute to the dead Curtis, “The Missing Boy.”

For people respond to Burial’s work in a way that is different to anybody else in dance music—different even from the cult reverence for Aphex Twin. Fans testify in a much more alternative-rock way about how his tunes “saved my life.” The sound of Burial has touched people, opened them up to difficult emotions, hurt them in valuable ways.

As well as the reggae-to-rave and post-punk traditions, there’s a third zone of contemporary music with which Burial has an affinity: hauntology, that largely British genre of eerie electronics fixated on ideas of decaying memory and lost futures. You can hear it in Burial’s love of spooky atmospheres, disquieting sound effects, the hiss and crackle of vinyl—all hallmarks of artists like the Caretaker, who has released a series of foggy, elegiac works across nearly two decades. Even the way Burial talks about his music aligns closely with Ghost Box, the UK label that’s home to spectral audio exponents like the Focus Group and Belbury Poly. The short-lived spate of interviews he did around *Untrue* teem with references to uncanny presences, subliminal hums, moments when you glance at the face of a friend or family member and catch something alien in their expression. Burial even enthused about his childhood love of the ghost stories of M.R. James, one of those gentlemen occultist writers who are touchstones for the UK hauntologists.

Interviewed by the late British critic Mark Fisher, Burial spoke of creepy epiphanies he’d experienced walking through deserted night-time areas of London: “Sometimes you get that feeling like a ghost touched your heart, like someone walks with you.” Song titles like “Archangel” and “Feral Witchchild” suggest superstitious thinking, or at least an openness to the idea that there are supernatural dimensions, other realms that leak through into our reality in the form of visions or unsettling sensations.

An early champion of Burial, Fisher provided an enduringly compelling interpretation of his work. Writing [first in his blog](http://k-punk.abstractdynamics.org/archives/007666.html), Kpunk, and later in *The Wire*, Fisher pegged Burial’s self-titled 2006 debut album as an “an elegy for the hardcore continuum”: A misty-eyed memorial to the British subculture of pirate radio and warehouse raves that coalesced at the end of the ’80s, evolved through mutant ’90s styles like jungle and 2-step garage, then splintered into 21st century offshoots like grime and dubstep. Listening to *Burial*, Fisher wrote, felt “like walking into the abandoned spaces once carnivalized by raves and finding them returned to depopulated dereliction. Muted air horns flare like the ghosts of raves past.”

This idea that the debut was less an album of contemporary dance music than an album *about* the glories of UK dance music’s past was bolstered by soundbites like the one in “Gutted.” Sampled from Jim Jarmusch’s 1999 movie *Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai*, the voice of Forest Whitaker murmurs: “Me and him, we’re from different, ancient tribes… now we’re both almost extinct… sometimes you gotta stick with the ancient ways… old-school ways.” On *Untrue*, the closing track “Raver” reprises the idea with its vocal licks about “dream life” and a long-gone world that was “easy.” During rave’s early ’90s peak, a multitude of tracks featured the word “dream,” often with an undertone suggesting that participants in the movement knew deep down that it was all *just* a dream, that utopia built on a chemical could only be a flimsy and transitory construction. This could offer another shade of meaning to “untrue”: Rave as the dream that died, or worse, the dream that *lied*. Indeed, the phrase “dream life” in “Raver” could be heard as “dream-lie.”

In his *Untrue*-era interviews, Burial often refers to “unity,” music’s power to dissolve divisions. Talking about the rave era’s classic anthems, he told *FACT* magazine, “It sounds stupid, but it’s like they were trying to unite the whole UK, but they failed. So when I listen back to them I get kind of sad.” Too young to participate directly during rave’s ’90s prime, Burial got a second-hand dose of the vibe via the vinyl 12"s and mixtapes that his older brother played him along with the stories he brought home of his raving exploits. Like those who came of age in the ’70s feeling like they’d missed the great ’60s adventure, Burial feasted on the recorded relics and fetishized the legend. Rave, for Burial, is almost like an implanted memory.

Behind the ghost of rave haunting Burial’s music lurks another specter: socialism. The concept of hauntology was originally coined by the philosopher Jacques Derrida in 1993 to evoke how, even after the fall of Communism and the triumph of globalized free market capitalism, the contemporary world remained haunted by that movement’s originating ideals: social justice, equality, a kinder world free of exploitation and deprivation.

These ideological battles played out in late 20th century Britain in ways that formed the background to Burial’s music and shaped his bleak vision of modern urban life. Tony Blair’s New Labour party co opted D:Ream’s 1993 pop-rave anthem “Things Can Only Get Better” as the theme for its successful 1997 election campaign, which ended 18 years of Conservative party rule. But it was only by abandoning Labour’s longstanding commitment to public stewardship of the economy and by distancing itself from the unions that Blair was able to get his hands on power.

The 13 years of New Labour rule that ensued—the period in which Burial came of age and created his two albums—were essentially the extension of Margaret Thatcher’s post-socialist vision for Britain, deep into the 21st century. Workers increasingly submitted to “flexible” employment (no guaranteed number of [hours per week](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-23573442), last minute notifications) that left employees in a permanent state of anxious uncertainty. Welfare became a punitive system designed to push people into the job market. Compulsory “jobseeker” training sessions aimed to instill qualities like positivity, relentlessly pounding into the unemployed the idea that failure was the result of an individual deficiency of initiative rather than larger economic forces. And after Labour’s introduction of tuition fees for students, many graduates found themselves burdened with debt and confronting an employment landscape of endless internships or the non-career-track jobs of the “[gig economy](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/oct/17/sometimes-you-dont-feel-human-how-the-gig-economy-chews-up-and-spits-out-millennials).”

To a large degree, the Thatcher project was to make Britain more like America in its attitudes to work and enterprise, and that project continued under Blair. The end result is a stark feeling of being on your own in this life; your fate is in your own hands. “It’s easy to fall away and fuck up, and for many people there’s no safety net,” Burial told *The Wire* in 2007. As dissected in Fisher’s book *Capitalist Realism: Is There No Alternative?*, the result of this new precariousness has been pandemic levels of mental illness, rising suicide rates, and widespread dependence on anti-depression and anti-anxiety meds.

Where dance music is generally about abandon, Burial’s music is about abandonment. Listening to his work, I’m sometimes reminded of nothing so much as the Beatles’ “Eleanor Rigby”—one long lament for “all the lonely people” adrift in the modern city. Again, just look at the titles: “Loner,” “Broken Home,” “Rough Sleeper,” “Homeless,” “Fostercare.” With “Dog Shelter,” Burial even has empathy to spare for all the lonely canines. (As it happens, around the time of making *Untrue*, he was actually mourning the death of a beloved dog.)

When his songs aren’t about feeling bereft and forsaken, the titles point to emotional damage, or its corollary, the capacity of damaged people to lash out and perpetuate the cycle: “Wounder,” “Gutted,” “U Hurt Me,” “Young Death.” It’s like Burial’s antennae are tuned into the frequencies of pain emanating from the metropolis, all the human flotsam and jetsam who have bailed out from abusive family situations or cycled downwards through self-destructive behaviors.

On July 7, 2005, a series of coordinated terrorist attacks killed and maimed a diverse mixture of Londoners setting off for work on an overstretched public transportation system. The fact that it was an assault on public spaces where the city’s mongrel population mingle seemed to have particularly affected Burial. His own travel plans disrupted by the chaos on that day, he headed on foot from South London into the city center, and then back again, during which time he listened intermittently to a mixtape of jungle and dubstep tunes he’d compiled. The city felt “like it had been hurt,” he told journalist and producer Martin Clark later that year. “All the dubstep and jungle shit became like comfort music: The sorrow just came out of it. I felt the music deeper from that point on.”

The trauma of 7/7 shaped Burial’s conception of what his own music could become. “A Burial album would sound deep and hypnotic at the start,” he told Clark in late 2005, a good six months before the debut’s release. “Just like someone picking themselves up, fixing up, getting by. The middle of the album would be proper underground, more rolled out, and then the end would be club tunes, like, ‘He made it out of there’.... But the whole thing would be sad. I can’t help it. London feels sad to me, but there’s uplift in there.”

The “uplift” comes from the way that the city creates epiphanies of grandeur, through the scope it offers for heroic aloneness and apartness. Burial’s *Untrue* track “In McDonalds” could be an updated audio translation of Edward Hopper’s “Nighthawks” painting. Like Hopper’s brightly-lit diner surrounded by dark deserted streets, the tacky non-space of the fast-food eatery is a haven for the weary and cash-poor. And *Untrue*’s cover drawing could be a Burial self-portrait in the Hopper mode: Moody in a hoodie, eyes and mouth downturned, lost in his own thoughts as a cup of coffee steams into the café’s cold air.

The most famous of Burial’s locales of loneliness, though, is the “Night Bus,” as immortalized on the debut album. Every city in the world has night buses, but there is a specific London resonance to this mode of transport. Until quite recently, when the London subway finally went to 24-hour service, the double decker night bus was the only option for clubbers who couldn’t afford a taxi. Since these cash-strapped youth typically lived in the low-rent, furthest-out zones of the city, this meant that the after-rave experience involved a long journey home. A comedown from the collective high, the bus returned ravers to privatized isolation, but offered the consolation prize of a twinkling, kinetic view of the city. The beat-free, strings-swept tingle of “Night Bus” captures the poignancy of “the afterglow”—Burial’s term for the relationship between his music and rave culture.

Seeing the cityscape from an elevated perspective is integral to the *mise-en-scène* of Burial’s cinematic sound. The cover of the debut album told us how to hear this music: It’s an aerial view of the South London borough of Wandsworth, symbolizing “a pirate signal above London, just floating in the air,” Burial has said. In the interview with Clark, Burial described how he made his tunes in a room whose window overlooked a prison, its grounds, and a stretch of South London freeway that sloped down to the River Thames, with the entire vista often shrouded in wintry mist. “Southern Comfort,” his first classic tune, has a rolling fog-bank sound and a majestic sense of looking down from above.

That aura of altitude in Burial’s music, along with the feeling of pained empathy in tracks like “Broken Home,” is surely what made me flash on the movie *Wings of Desire* when I reviewed his debut in 2006. Wim Wenders’ 1987 film is a mood piece about the kindness of guardian angels who invisibly soothe suffering humans. On *Untrue*, this latent idea became explicit with the album’s first song, “Archangel.” “My new tunes are about... wanting an angel watching over you, when there’s nowhere to go and all you can do is sit in McDonalds late at night, not answering your phone,” Burial told *The Wire*.

Beyond the overt religiosity of titles like “Prayer” and “Prophecy,” there’s a feeling in Burial’s music of reaching out in the darkness to higher powers. When collective dreaming—whether via progressive political projects or music movements like punk or rave—fades from the scene, people look to other sources of strength: traditional organized religions but also pulp spirituality, quasi-magical techniques of positive thinking, and other feel-good salves.

The spiritual yearning in Burial’s music stems partly from the influence of Todd Edwards, an American garage producer whose impact in the UK far surpasses his modest profile in his homeland. A devout Christian whose music often bears titles like *Isaiah 41:13* and “Saved My Life,” Edwards developed a production style that he dubbed “The Sample Choir”: chopping up soulful vocals into miniscule snippets, then weaving them into a rapturously rejoicing tapestry of gasps and blurts. Edwards’ innovations contributed to the rise of “vocal science,” a term originally coined by UK dance pundit Anindya Bhattacharyya, which involves techniques of micro-editing vocal samples into new melodic and rhythmic patterns. This had been a fixture of UK rave music from the start, but Edwards’ virtuosity pushed it to next level. His tracks “Push the Love” and “Never Far From You” were massive hits on the UK garage scene in the late ’90s, and vocal science became a hallmark of the 2-step garage sound, which is the primary template on which Burial’s music is based.

Burial’s own use of vocal science harked back both to rave’s ecstatic pyrotechnics and 2-step’s sultry amorousness. But the mood now tilted to the somber. Circa *Untrue*, Burial talked about being “obsessed” with making his music “glow a bit more” compared with the first album: “having these little clips of vocals, and tiny moments of warmth for a split-second, and then it would go.” He compared the vocals to “embers” that fade out quickly, leaving an “eerie and empty” darkness.

Vocal science derives its frisson from the juxtaposition of something intimate and bodily—the human voice—with cold-blooded technicality. Chopping and resequencing a vocal performance into a new shape is like vivisection and Frankenstein-style recombination. “I cut up a capellas and made different sentences, even if they didn’t make sense but they summed up what I was feeling,” Burial told *The Wire*. The remark shows how his artistry involves literally speaking through the voices of others, but it also points to the spookiness of sampling in general, and vocal science in particular. Really, it’s closer to sorcery than science: taking a performer’s deeply personal and most inmost possession, and making that voice sing melodies and transmit feelings at your command.

Perhaps that’s why Burial often locates the sampled vocals in his tracks in an uncanny realm, comparing them at various points to the sound of “a banshee, a strange, wounded animal cry,” “something not human I’ve got chained up in the yard,” and a “forbidden siren,” at once a reference to the sirens of classical legend, bird-women whose seductive tones lured sailors to shipwreck—and a nod to a PlayStation game.

Burial manipulates phrases like “holding you,” “if I trust you,” and “tell me I belong” like an expert glassblower, distending them into glistening bubbles of decontextualized passion. The transparency of specific meaning is gone but the translucence of pure emotion glows even more intensely.

Just as Todd Edwards’ sample choir is overtly angelic and thus genderless, Burial is drawn to the way that vocal science can etherealize the source, rendering it androgynous. “I wanted to make something that was kind of half-boy, half-girl” is how he described *Untrue* to Anwen Crawford. Later, Burial would articulate this implicit genderfluid politics with the track “Come Down to Us,” on 2013’s *Rival Dealer* EP, which features soundbites about self-acceptance and sexual blurriness, including words from a speech by the trans filmmaker Lana Wachowski delivered when receiving the Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award.

You could make a case for Burial’s music as radically androgynous: open-hearted, aching with empathy, unafraid of prettiness or heart-tugging emotion. *Untrue* was in fact conceived as a sort of “pop” move, its emphasis on vocals differentiating it from the emaciated brutalism of dubstep, which, if it featured vocals at all, usually went for gruff roots reggae samples. Prior to embarking on *Untrue*, Burial had actually produced a whole album’s worth of material in a darker, technically-intricate style of hyper-masculine moodiness. “All the tunes sounded like some kind of weapon that was being taken apart and put back together again,” he told *The Wire*. But he scrapped that album in its entirety, discouraged by the fact that his mother hadn’t liked any of the tunes he’d played her, and started again in a totally new direction based around ecstatic vocal samples. (Liberated by the impulsive decision to jettison all that hard work, Burial knocked out *Untrue* in just a couple of weeks.)

It’s hard to imagine anybody else in dubstep reacting so drastically to a negative maternal verdict, but then, as Burial told *The* *Wire*, “I was brought up most by my mum, I’m my mum’s son. I look like her. *I am her.”* Of *Untrue*, he offered, “Blokes might be, like, ‘What the fuck is this?’ But hopefully their girlfriends will like it.”

Here Burial placed himself firmly on one side of a divide running through UK rave culture, whose evolution has involved a pendulum-like shift back and forth between two poles that I like to characterize as “feminine pressure” versus “masculine armor.” The latter is a lineage that is militaristic, scientific, and apocalyptic in vibe—a vein of dark, stark tracks that runs from techstep to the most mechanistic and bass-bombastic dubstep. The feminine pressure strand embraces vocal melody, song structure (albeit fractured), film-score orchestrations, and a bursting emotionalism: Its high points include early rave, the ambient and jazzy directions in drum & bass, the breakaway style known as happy hardcore, and the entire UK garage phase, but especially 2-step.

Burial’s loping grooves and skippy woodblock snares have much more in common with UK garage than with the clanking lurch of dubstep. The roots of his style are tracks like Groove Chronicles’ 2-step classic “Stone Cold,” which layered sultry slices of Aaliyah’s yearning vocal from “One in a Million” over languidly swinging drums and a moody bass-drone. But instead of the feverish sexuality in 2-step, Burial picks up on the neediness and the longing.

Released by Hyperdub on November 5, 2007, *Untrue* was showered with critical praise. Named Album of the Year in major publications, it would go on to be nominated for the UK’s Mercury Prize in 2008. In the meanwhile, *Untrue*’s impact on the UK dance scene had started to come through in the form of a self-conscious turn towards emotionality: not the primary-color, explosive emotions of old skool rave, but subtle shades of introspective melancholy. Producers like James Blake, Jamie Woon, and Darkstar went even further than Burial, incorporating their own vocals into the music and writing actual songs. Some callous wag dubbed this mixed-blessing of a trend “[blubstep](http://blissout.blogspot.com/2010/04/blubstep-looking-at-april-17-malcolm.html)” (OK, it was me) as producer after producer announced that their greatest ambition was to make people cry on the dancefloor.

Burial’s influence was also evident in the work of UK dance producers like Andy Stott and Raime. The latter’s label, Blackest Ever Black, deepened the occult links between post-punk and post-dubstep that Burial had hinted at, exploring the unlikely dancefloor potential of ’80s goth and industrial sounds. The xx offered another version of this connection, their music fusing Burial’s doleful moodiness with the spare intimacy of post punks Young Marble Giants. On his solo track “Gosh,” that band’s Jamie xx participated in another persistent trend that owes something to Burial: A strain of retro-rave in which bygone styles like hardcore and jungle are created as faded facsimiles, at once precise in every period detail yet hazy like the memories in an aged raver’s brain. You could detect faint far-flung traces of the Burial aesthetic in the ambient amorphousness of cloud rap, while a quasi-genre of cinematically melancholy, inwardly-focused music sourced from diverse points in the modern music landscape was dubbed “Night Bus” in clear homage to the maker of the track of the same name.

In another sense, you could say that Burial certainly was early to tap into—if not invent—an emotional tenor that characterizes our era and which Mark Fisher [dubbed](http://www.electronicbeats.net/mark-fisher-recommends-james-blakes-overgrown/) “the secret sadness of the 21st century.” The peg for this coinage was James Blake’s 2013 album *Overgrown*, but the listless mood of vague gloom was something you could track all across the spectrum, a hollow-souled emptiness lurking within the seemingly triumphant hedonism of Drake, Kanye West, Future, the Weeknd, and Travi$ Scott.

Burial himself has not attempted to follow up *Untrue*. Instead he’s broken out with a sporadic scatter of smaller statements. Some of his EPs have been almost as long as an old fashioned vinyl LP but consisted of just three tracks: Extended pieces, full of shifts, switches, and subsections that, as Pitchfork’s Mark Richardson wrote, “feel like miniature albums” in their own right.

No real direction has been discernible in his post-*Untrue* music. Some of the tracks are an extension and consummation of *Untrue*: “Stolen Dog,” for instance, is a widescreen ache of anguish woven from piteous moans and strangled mewls, gorgeously evoking the misery of the dog wrenched from home and family, the grief of the original owner, perhaps even the desperation of the thief. Elsewhere there were unexpected flavors of trance-pop, as on “Ashtray Wasp” and “Come Down to Us”—a disconcerting proximity to the world of Calvin Harris. Other tracks seemed deliberately, almost perversely, unpolished, or vandalized on a whim by their creator after completion. “Rough Sleeper” and “Truant” resembled radios drifting between stations.

A gathering formlessness makes itself felt in Burial’s music as we approach the present: Tracks that crumble away suddenly, like a sandcastle reclaimed by the surf, or halt as if suddenly vacated by the will to continue. This year’s “Beachfires” and “Subtemple” are rhythmless chasms of droning ambience and found sounds that have more in common with experimental industrial outfits like Zoviet France than anything in the UK rave tradition.

These featureless expanses of sound parallel the steadfast erasure of Burial’s public profile since *Untrue*. To my knowledge, since the spate of interviews around that album, he has not spoken to the press. Most likely his withdrawal is a reaction to the forced exposure of his real-world identity in 2008. He went public with his name and face that year, but only as a preemptive measure to undercut mainstream newspaper journalists bent on sleuthing out the truth.

Burial’s initial intent was always to stay true to the radical anonymity and facelessness of rave culture and underground techno. Like some of us, he grew up fascinated by the enigmatic and outlandish artist names—LTJ Bukem, Rufige Kru, Foul Play, 2 Bad Mice, Dr S Gachet—that offered no clues to the color or class of these shadowy operators, no hint of where they came from, or even how many people were involved. (Omni Trio, for instance, turned out to be just one bloke.)

“I want to be unknown,” Burial declared in the 2007 *Wire* interview. “Most of the tunes I like, I never knew what the people who made them looked like, anyway. It draws you in. You could believe in it more... I just want to be in a symbol... the name of a tune.” After a brief dalliance with attention circa *Untrue*, Burial has done his best to go back to being an anonymous enigma. Not an actual human mired in the mundane, but a spirit observing London from on high.
