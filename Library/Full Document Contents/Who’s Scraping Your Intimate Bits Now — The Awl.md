It is funny how this assumes [that there is such a thing as a non-creepy startup](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2016/06/09/creepy-startup-will-help-landlords-employers-and-online-dates-strip-mine-intimate-data-from-your-facebook-page). Everything is gross and everything is predicated on the idea that you are data to be mined and sold. The only thing more disgusting than the lies we’ve been told about innovation and convenience is your willing complicity in this sickening system. You deserve everything you get.
