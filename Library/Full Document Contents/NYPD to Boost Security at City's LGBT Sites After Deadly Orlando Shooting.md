NEW YORK CITY — The NYPD will increase security at key LGBT community centers throughout the city in the wake of the deadly Orlando attack, the worst mass shooting in the nation's history, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday.

Forty-nine people were killed and 53 others were injured when a gunman opened fire at the gay nightclub Pulse in Orlando, Fla., early Sunday morning. President Barack Obama called the attack an act of terrorism in an afternoon press conference.

While there were no specific terrorist threats facing the city, de Blasio said, NYPD and federal counter-terrorism officers will increase their presence at key sites in the city, including those of the gay community.

"You will see a lot of additional police presence on the streets of this city," he said Sunday afternoon after marching in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. "You’ll see additional police presence in some of the heavy-trafficked areas of our city today. You’ll see police presence in front of some key LGBT community institutions – protecting the people of this city."

At least two vigils were planned for Sunday night to honor those killed in the attacks. [One is in Jackson Heights and the other in Greenwich Village](https://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20160612/jackson-heights/vigils-be-held-tonight-for-victims-of-orlando-shooting-heres-where).

Pride Week begins in New York City on June 19.

Asked by reporters about security measures for that event, the mayor said attendees "will be very well protected. We’re the most prepared city of any city in the country to prevent terrorism and have been doing it non-stop for 15 years."
