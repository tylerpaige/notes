Summary: AI video generation models such as Open AI’s Sora make it possible to create ultra-realistic animations from scratch and seamlessly merge disparate visual content into new synthetic media. For its developers, however, Sora seems more than just a tool; they rather see it as a “world simulator.” But if Sora, trained on online video content scraped from YouTube or generated by game engines such as Unreal, is supposed to simulate a world, what world is it? As the short essay argues, it is a world of constant modulation and endless flows of patterns—a flat world, the world of platform capitalism.

When OpenAI announced its new text-to-video AI model, Sora, in February 2024, the official demo clips created a veritable buzz and quickly spread across media platforms.[[1]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-1) But to this day, no one knows when Sora will be available to the general public—if ever. And while there has been much speculation about whether Sora could change film production forever, the testimony of those embedded artists who were given early access to the software makes such claims seem doubtful at best. For example, Patrick Cederberg of Shy Kids, whose “Air Head” was one of the first narrative shorts produced with Sora, compared the software to a “slot machine.”[[2]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-2) To generate a short clip, you first have to enter a prompt, but how the model interprets this prompt is almost impossible to predict, and the same prompt entered repeatedly will produce different results. As in Dall-E and other text-to-image models, prompts are not treated as operative code to be executed; rather, they function as search commands to navigate a statistical space of possible results, a space ultimately intransparent and even unstable.[[3]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-3) Cederberg estimates that the production of “Air Head” required around 300 failed generation attempts for every take in the final cut. Moreover, even the generated clips that eventually made it into the final film required extensive correction in post-production. Not unlike other generative AI models, Sora produces mostly garbage—while wasting a lot more computing power, resources, and energy in the process.[[4]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-4)

For filmmakers, working with Sora thus means less, not more, control over the material than with more traditional digital production technologies, especially as many aesthetic parameters cannot be influenced at all via the prompt. At least in the version of the software used by Shy Kids, it was impossible to specify shot sizes and camera movements. And while Sora surpasses previous AI video models in terms of object permanence within a clip, meaning that bodies and things retain a stable external shape even when other objects temporarily cover them, it does not offer the option of having the same character appear in different clips or showing the same room from different angles.[[5]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-5) Anyone wishing to assemble a film from individual clips must, therefore, begin to understand the model’s output as a kind of found footage, as Sora generates a completely new synthetic reality with each new prompt.

For its developers, however, Sora is much more than just a tool for automated video production. They see it as a “world simulator,” or at least a “promising path towards building general purpose simulators of the physical world.”[[6]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-6) From the countless training videos fed to the model, it is said to have learned not only what the world looks like but also what physical dynamics are at work in it: how bodies move through space and what forces act on them. All this knowledge is supposed to be an effect of “scaling” alone: Sora and similar complex, so-called “foundational” AI models are supposed to gain emergent abilities they were never programmed for, mainly by increasing the amount of data they process.[[7]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-7) Unlike game engines such as Unreal, which are able to visualize complex three-dimensional visual worlds because they are equipped with specialized algorithms to simulate reflections and lighting conditions, the behavior of liquids, or the effects of collisions on different surfaces, Sora does not become a potential world simulator on the basis of any such previous modelling of the world.[[8]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-8) Rather, it develops what it considers to be “the world” from processing endless hours of two-dimensional video material scraped from the web or, as was speculated early on, generated by game engines specifically for training purposes. OpenAI’s idea of world simulation thus presupposes a world that has already become an image—even if that image may itself be largely the product of simulation techniques.

So, what kind of world does Sora show us? Not only is it a flat world, a world derived out of two-dimensional images; it is also, and at the same time, a world of permanent flux, a world in constant motion. It is no coincidence that OpenAI’s most impressive demo videos often look like video games or drone footage: One image flows into the next, and the view floats weightlessly over cities and landscapes, following people, animals, and vehicles from a bird’s eye view. However, it is not only the virtual camera—or what has taken its place—that seems to move through these synthetic image spaces without any physical constraints; human bodies also create an almost floating impression, as if they are gliding without resistance through worlds without substance. The hyperrealism of these clips feels almost dreamlike, not least because actions in this world rarely have visible consequences, as OpenAI demonstrates in a series of demos: One video, for example, shows an elderly lady trying to blow out the candles on her birthday cake as prompted—but none of the flames flicker even a little. In somewhat more complicated cases, such as when a glass falls over, all object stability is lost. Instead of shattering, the glass begins to deform grotesquely beyond all physical plausibility. Even stranger is the fate of a plastic chair dug out of the sand by a team of archaeologists. Not only does it constantly change its shape, but towards the end of the short clip, it almost seems as if it wants to run away by itself.[[9]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-9)

In the world of Sora, cause and effect appear largely decoupled from one another, and objects, despite their supposed permanence, threaten to double, dissolve, disintegrate, or even take on a life of their own. OpenAI tries to play down this fundamental inconsistency of its synthetic worlds as a temporary weakness. Certainly, some of the more obvious flaws will disappear in future versions. However, there are reasons to wonder if Sora will ever develop anything like an understanding of complex physical worlds.[[10]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-10) Generative AI models such as ChatGPT or Sora are technologies for simulating coherence based on probabilities: They have been trained to plausibly predict which sentence will follow next and which image could continue all previous ones. The aesthetics of continuous flow that Sora (re)produces so perfectly, therefore, do not merely mirror popular digital visual worlds between video games, influencer video, Go-Pro, and drone aesthetics but also result from the generative logic of the model itself, in which each new image appears as a further element in a potentially endlessly continuable series of transformations and modulations of generic patterns. Any impression of continuity and permanence is ultimately merely an effect of visual plausibilities; it owes nothing to a knowledge of the physical world and its laws but rather to a knowledge of the probabilities with which images follow after one another.

This production principle of a continuous flow of images also results in the software’s more impressive (and potentially dangerous) capabilities to synthetically extend an existing video clip and seamlessly transition from documentary footage to its purely fictional continuation. Time thus becomes almost infinitely stretchable and can even be closed into an endless loop by steering the synthetically added sequences back toward the original image. Any single image can also become the starting point for video synthesis, as OpenAI demonstrates using the example of a kitchen scene generated by Dall-E. In a synthetic camera pan, the nostalgic setting, densely filled with shiny copper pots and chefs in white uniforms, expands into a larger and larger kitchen. However, nothing new comes into view, just more pots and more cooks—far too many cooks.[[11]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-11) Despite the seamless continuity of images and the redundancy of the motifs, you feel like you are in a completely different space at the end of the shot. It seems impossible to draw a floor plan of this kitchen, which never existed as a three-dimensional spatial construction, but rather unfolded image by image. In other words, spatial coherence here becomes a dependent variable of temporal continuity, and, as in a dream, these spatial sequences only appear plausible as long as we follow the flow of images without looking back.

As Anna Kornbluh recently pointed out, an aesthetic of boundlessness and continuous flow has become a characteristic of a “too-late capitalism” in which the circulation of seemingly immaterial images has long since turned out to be the main engine of value creation.[[12]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-12) In this sense, Open AI’s demo clips show us glimpses into a dream world of platform capitalism, a closed world of endlessly flowing patterns, a world without duration, gravity, or depth, a world in which space becomes the effect of continuous circulation and time can be stretched, reversed, and looped without consequence.[[13]](https://rrrreflect.org/special-issue-1/its-a-flat-world-the-synthetic-realities-of-sora#footnote-13)

These videos thus seem less about promoting a product called Sora that may (or may not) eventually be available and more about raising more and more attention, expectations, and, above all, capital for the company and its promise of future AI revolutions. However, beyond the endless flows, infinite loops, and warped spaces of Sora’s synthetic dream worlds, actions have consequences in the real world. Ultimately, the promise of “scaling” is little more than the contemporary actualization of an ideology of unlimited growth and expansion—and continues its logic of extraction, exploitation, and waste of natural resources into an ever more precarious future, while producing more and more variations of generic patterns.
