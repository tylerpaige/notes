Trevor Paglen is no stranger to spy games. Over the past decade, the Berlin-based photographer has [focused his lens on the secret infrastructure of surveillance](https://archive.is/o/3FhFl/https://www.wsj.com/articles/photographer-trevor-paglen-turns-surveillance-into-art-1465579257), from eerie images of eavesdropping satellites streaking across starry skies to murky photographs of fiber-optic cables funneling encrypted data across ocean floors. For his efforts, he has received [acclaim from curators and collectors](https://archive.is/o/3FhFl/https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fine-art-of-spying-1379032309) and, he says, suspicious inquires from government agencies.

Paglen, 42, was born and raised on a Maryland military base. He studied art but also earned a doctorate in geography. Those symbiotic disciplines have enabled him to locate and photograph the kind of top-secret intelligence compounds and spy hubs that don’t usually appear on maps. He has photographed everything from an NSA listening station in West Virginia to a secret CIA prison in Afghanistan, which appears in his 2009 book “Blank Spots on the Map: The Dark Geography of the Pentagon’s Secret World.”

Paglen’s work comes at a moment when surveillance and intelligence gathering are receiving unprecedented scrutiny. And he’s part of a generation of artists who have not been shy about watching the watchers. The artist Ai Weiwei, for his series titled “Surveillance Camera,” carved marble sculptures of the 12 CCTV video cameras that Chinese authorities installed outside his Beijing studio after he criticized the government. In 2005, the New York artist Jill Magid was commissioned by the Dutch secret service to make art for its headquarters in The Hague; she interviewed 18 Dutch agents about their jobs and personal lives, and submitted her notebooks to the agency as art. The agency rejected the piece and censored 40% of the material for security reasons—but Magid was allowed to exhibit the redacted notebooks at London’s Tate Modern.

Paglen takes both a confrontational and a collaborative approach to depicting the infrastructure and architecture of government surveillance. When [Edward Snowden leaked National Security Agency records in 2013](https://archive.is/o/3FhFl/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323495604578535653583992418), Paglen noticed that many news story carried the same photo of the agency’s headquarters—shot from a distance and, according to the captions, supplied by the NSA itself. Paglen examined the photo closely and determined, based on the cars in the agency’s parking lot, that it had been taken sometime in the early 1970s. “Volkswagen Beetles and things like that,” Paglen says. “And I thought, ‘How strange that we’re learning all of this information about this agency that very few people even knew existed, and yet the image that we have of it is 40 years old.’”

The location of NSA’s headquarters—Fort Meade, Md.—is available to anyone; permission to photograph the building is not. Paglan submitted a request to update the official portrait of the NSA’s headquarters and, after three months of negotiation, received a green light from the agency. He rented a helicopter and shot the building from the air at night. His portrait shows the complex’s creamy brick facade and half-empty parking lot bathed in the orange and green fluorescent glow of floodlights and passing traffic. The old black-and-white photo evokes a nostalgia for Cold War espionage; Paglen’s portrait seems to hum with the electricity that underlies the digital age.

“Many of the things that shape the way the world looks are quite frankly invisible,” Paglan said, adding that he was struck by the office-park ordinariness of the NSA’s facade. The NSA, either unaware of or indifferent to Paglen’s intent, uses the portrait as its new official image for mass distribution.

On Sept. 7, the New York gallery Metro Pictures will unveil Mr. Paglen’s newest body of work, which investigates the algorithms used in facial-recognition software—technology that essentially teaches machines how to see. In these photographic and video works, viewers can sometimes see surrealistic images of faces and interiors that the machines have “recognized” and re-created using the software. He also intends to project a photograph that probes a different, though still politically potent, landscape. Earlier this spring, he drove from California to Texas to film the border between the U.S. and Mexico. “Our border is so vast,” he said, “and this wall we have—and are trying to build higher—just crystallizes our surveillance of it.”
