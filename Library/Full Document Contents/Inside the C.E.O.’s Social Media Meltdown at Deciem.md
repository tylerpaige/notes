In the last two years, The Ordinary has become one of the hottest brands in skin care, selling no-fuss products at a fraction of the prices of its competitors, to the obsessive delight of young consumers.

The Ordinary is one of a cluster of brands run by Deciem, which was founded in 2013 by a computer programmer named Brandon Truaxe.

Mr. Truaxe on Tuesday capped off a year of increasingly outlandish behavior with a [minute-long Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/Boq-xCIA5fx/?taken-by=deciem) [video](https://www.instagram.com/p/Boq-xCIA5fx/?taken-by=deciem) posted to the Deciem account, in which he said that the company would stop all operations. In an incoherent monologue, apparently filmed in the back of a moving car, he said that almost everyone at Deciem “has been involved in a major criminal activity, which includes financial crimes.”

Emails obtained by The New York Times sent by Mr. Truaxe before and after the video was posted show that his behavior was similarly disorderly in private. In one email, sent Tuesday afternoon with the subject line “EXECUTIVE ORDER 2.12.10.10.18,” the Deciem founder said: “All offices, production facilities and stores are shut down as of this moment.”

In the email, he also insulted and threatened his employees and informed someone named “Anand” that “your employment with DECIEM has been terminated as of this instant.” The company’s chief financial officer is named Anand Khanzode.

“If one more instruction that any of you received from me is not followed with precise attention to time efficiency and to the best of your abilities, I will terminate your employment immediately,” Mr. Truaxe wrote.

He then threatened to release employees’ private messages through Deciem’s social media channels. He identified specific employees by their emails and first names, several times suggesting that someone had changed the password to at least one of the company’s social media accounts without his permission. (Mr. Truaxe announced [in January](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeVuAzugG-7/?utm_source=ig_embed) he would control the company’s social media accounts himself.)

A person familiar with the email who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the company said that the messages were typical of what they described as Mr. Truaxe’s bullying, threatening style.

In another email, sent a week before the video was posted, Mr. Truaxe took a more gentle tone, praising two employees for their “humility” and asking them to “dedicate ten days to spending time with me.” He declared that “the next few days will be more instrumental for DECIEM than DECIEM’s birth in 2012.”

Referring to himself occasionally in the third person, he told the Deciem staff that “my love and respect for you is immense” and asked that they pay close attention to “the communication that DECIEM will share with our world during the few weeks and months ahead of us.”

Stephen Kaplan, formerly Deciem’s chief financial officer, left the company in February. He said in an email Wednesday that he had resigned “because Brandon’s demeanor had changed following a December vacation in Mongolia.”

Mr. Kaplan said that he had “no interest in all the current drama.”

“I feel sorry for all the staff that must deal with Brandon on a day-to-day basis,” he said. “Until he changes his ways, he is destroying what could have been a very successful company.”

An investor in the company indicated that it was also troubled by Mr. Truaxe’s behavior.

“The Estée Lauder Companies is a minority investor in Deciem, and, as such, we do not control the company’s operations, social media or personnel decisions,” said a spokeswoman for Estée Lauder Companies. “We are deeply concerned by the material that has recently been posted on social media and will defend our rights as a minority investor.”

Mr. Truaxe answered his phone on Wednesday but hung up when a reporter asked permission to record the call; following calls went to voice mail.

The Instagram video this week apparently signaling the end of Deciem sent many of the company’s customers into a frenzy as they sought to understand whether their preferred products would remain available. Many of the company’s New York stores were closed on Tuesday afternoon and its website indicated that almost all its stores around the world had been shuttered, including ten locations in Canada and four locations in the U.K. (Only its three stores in Mexico City were not marked as closed.)

Mr. Truaxe’s run of unusual behavior in public [began in late January](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeVuAzugG-7/?utm_), when he posted a video to Deciem’s Instagram account saying that he had canceled the company’s marketing plans. “From now on I am going to communicate personally with you,” he said. That was followed by a number of other strange videos: in one, Mr. Truaxe [changed his title](https://www.instagram.com/p/BeqoZKzAvdz/?utm_source=ig_embed), from C.E.O. to “Worker;” in another, he announced that Deciem would sever its relationship with Tijion Esho, a well-known cosmetic doctor [who was still promoting the lip care products](https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/a21086703/dr-tijion-esho-deciem/) he released with the company when news of the post broke.

Several weeks later, Deciem’s co-C.E.O. Nicola Kilner left the company, the first major internal rupture that could be linked to Mr. Truaxe’s erratic posting. (Ms. Kilner [later told Elle](https://www.elle.com/beauty/makeup-skin-care/a19694275/nicola-kilner-former-co-ceo-deciem-getting-fired-profile/) that she had argued with Mr. Truaxe over the announcement about Mr. Esho, and, days afterward, was informed by human resources that she was no longer a part of the company.)

After a chaotic flurry of news set off by Mr. Truaxe’s posts earlier in the year, Deciem seemed until this week to have regained some stability. In July, Ms. Kilner, widely viewed as a calming influence, confirmed to Racked that she [had rejoined the company.](https://www.racked.com/2018/7/3/17531420/deciem-nicola-kilner)

Though Deciem has had at least a dozen product lines, The Ordinary has been its most popular brand. Whereas many skin care products arrive as premade serums and cocktails, The Ordinary gained devotees by offering simpler solutions, such as its popular line of acids. Customers were encouraged to experiment with ingredients in order to concoct tailored regimens, a practice that has helped drive conversation around the brand on social media.

On Tuesday, that conversation mixed elements of alarm and bargain hunting as fans discussed the news and wondered whether products would remain available. Customers swapped rumors in [a private Facebook group with more than 57,000 members](https://www.facebook.com/groups/theordinarychatroombybbe/), while others flocked to [an Instagram fan account](https://www.instagram.com/deciemchatroom/) to discuss whether products could be ordered online. (For the most part, as of Tuesday afternoon, they reportedly could, though it was unclear whether products would be delivered.)

On Twitter, [many](https://twitter.com/dana_dane___/status/1049698159566286848) [users](https://twitter.com/lbardenwilliams/status/1049696594105372673) said that they were in the midst of a purchasing spree, even as they were not sure whether the company would continue to exist. Others wondered whether the whole debacle was a false alarm, or perhaps, some unintelligible form of marketing scam.
