#### Material Design’s new suite of tools and guidelines—all in one place

Design is the art of continuous problem solving—an active cycle of investigating and validating needs, crafting and developing ideas, and creating solutions. Over the course of its life, a digital product is shaped by many hands. The effects of this collaboration can be seen in the quality of a product’s identity and implementation, as well as in the strength of the community it builds.

We created Material Design as a metaphor to rationalize design and implementation, establishing a shared language to help teams unite style, branding, interaction, and motion under a cohesive set of principles.

We believe a better design process yields better products, which is why we’re expanding Material to be a system that supports the principles of good design and strengthens communication and productivity with new tools and inspiration. We hope these resources will help teams realize their greatest design potential, and we’re eager to see the results.

#### Material.io

In an effort to make all of Material Design more accessible, we’re bringing our existing work together in one place, [Material.io](http://material.io/). This site establishes a new visual identity for the Material initiative, one that will support our latest visual guidance and releases—from tools to reusable components and refined interactive motion.

Our new tools focus on different aspects of the product design process and streamline the way teams work, design, and build applications together. We’re previewing a few of them today, with more to come in the future.

**Gallery – Design collaboration, simplified**

Organize your design workflow in one place, so everyone on your team has a clear view of what’s going on. Easily share and get feedback on everything from visual designs to interactive prototypes—all easily accessible, beautifully presented, and securely managed.

**Stage – Dynamic interfaces with interactive motion**

Change the way you and your team design and build interactive experiences. Go beyond a process rooted in static design, and enable a more dynamic, intentional, and systematic workflow for crafting digital experiences.

Stage is being brought to you by the teams behind [Pixate](http://pixate.com/) and [Form](http://relativewave.com/).

**Remixer – Real-time, on-device, connected UI tweaks**

Refine aspects of your interface—from color palette to animation timing—right on your device. Make on-the-fly adjustments to your iOS, Android, and web interfaces, and even change values across multiple devices.

#### Community

Design is never done. We want Material Design to help you and your team evolve with a world of ever-changing techniques and technologies. We hope you will join us in this effort and build on these systems and tools with new processes of your own.

Watch for more news in the coming months about engineering frameworks and our new tools for motion work.
