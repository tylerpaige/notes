[[Eli Schiff - Uber’s Undoing Part I: Whipping Boy]]

In the past couple years, there have been dozens of redesigns that have grabbed my attention, sparked a fire to write—and then subsequently fizzled out, never to be realized.

But this time is different. This rebrand won’t get away with escaping the blog, because this is about Uber—the most reviled tech company in history. As I put it [previously](https://twitter.com/eli_schiff/status/943599327997517824), “If Uber didn’t exist, the tech industry would have to invent it. It’s the perfect exculpatory distraction for deflecting criticism.” Uber is, in other words, the industry’s whipping boy.

For the moment, ignore the scandalous reasons why Uber’s every move has captivated the masses. Even if Uber had never had a single meltdown, one would just have to look at their numbers to understand the company’s draw. Uber is worth 72 billion dollars, making it the most valuable privately-held company in the world. Compare that to its nearest industry competitor, Lyft, which is worth a mere 11.7 billion dollars.

Not only that, but this is a critical time in Uber’s ascendence, as it is on the precipice of going public in 2019. A lot is at stake. In that context, it makes sense why several weeks ago on September 12, 2018, Uber played the classic PR-dampening move—launching a major brand announcement during an Apple keynote.

At first, I was distraught this strategically timed launch might mean the rebrand would go without notice. As Josh Topolsky [exclaimed](https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky/status/1040272053620883456), “We need to talk about this.” I wholeheartedly agree.

The rebrand made a minor splash, but hardly the one it deserved. That calculated absence of intrigue is precisely why the rebrand warrants further study.

#### Icon Trajectory

![](https://elischiff.com/images/2018-10-10-Whatpeoplethink@2x.webp)What people think happened in the 2018 Uber rebrand given conventional reporting.
The reporting on Uber’s 2018 rebrand has been widespread, though plenty flawed. For one, it mostly consists of credulous praise for the company and its supposed newfound pure intentions.

Consider the analysis by Armin Vit, the design rebrand reviewer behind the site Brand New. Vit [gushed](https://underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/new_logo_and_identity_for_uber_by_wolff_olins_and_in_house.php) about the new logo.

>  The new logo is a definite line in the sand that moves Uber into a more positive and accessible aesthetic that puts functionality and practicality first…At first glance, the new logo is… nothing. It is the most bare-bones rendition possible of a company name. It barely registers as a logo…You might disagree with me: but it’s actually perfect. It’s not a perfect logo. It’s a perfect logo for Uber — now…It may potentially also communicate an unwelcome coldness that contrasts negatively from the warmth and friendliness implied in the Lyft brand and its drivers but, as long as Uber and its drivers stay on the straight and narrow, the associations should become positive… the logo is actually quite nice and as masterfully done…there is good deal of craftsmanship at work here that will serve this logo well in the long run.

As you can see, insofar as Vit was critical—and he most certainly was—he was sure to hedge every criticism of the brand by immediately turning negative attributes into virtues, and doing so with the most effusive praise possible.

I have to give credit where it’s due. Vit really knows how to uphold extremely friendly relations with design companies. That might be why Wolff Olins (one of the agencies Uber hired for the rebrand) gave him “exclusive” imagery in advance of his review, as he [bragged](https://vimeo.com/290771317) at his annual Brand New conference this September. Not only that, but his PR amplification didn’t go unnoticed by Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi himself, who [tweeted out](https://twitter.com/dkhos/status/1041703586491559939) Vit’s review less than two hours after it went live. We’ll return to some of Vit’s thoughts on the rebrand in due time.

But more than the general celebration of the new rebrand, and at-worst, skepticism towards it, the reported story behind the all-important icon has been incomplete at best.

![](https://elischiff.com/images/2018-10-10-icontrajectory@2x.webp)The actual history of the Uber icon (iOS).
In the limited coverage of the Uber’s icon history elsewhere, most publications missed the patterned 2016 icon as though Uber’s prior rebrand had never occurred. But the remaining few writers who did cover any interim icon ignored that Uber has transitioned icons not once, not even twice, but five times between 2016 and 2018.

Out of the recent icon redesigns, the first and most controversial iteration came in February 2016, featuring a bit (rounded rectangle) and atom (circle) motif overlaid on a patterned teal base. This icon bucked the trend of flatness with a minor, almost-invisible dropshadow.

Only a few short months later, in November 2016, Uber did the unthinkable. They released the bit and atom (with slightly different proportions) on an icon with perceptible depth. Not only did the treatment have a visible dropshadow, but it also had a [criminal](https://twitter.com/eli_schiff/status/793895347948953600) inner highlight.

Just over a year later in October 2017, following a redesign of the application UI, Uber launched a third variation on the bit and atom, this time set in all black, and with a new set of proportions—and of course, it was flat. When reached out for comment, an Uber representative [said](https://www.businessinsider.com/uber-changes-app-icon-again-2016-12) “we simplified the app’s icon to better match the look and the feel of the new app’s design.”

Strange then that despite their newfound commitment to consistency between the app and its icon, they snuck the November 2016 dimensional icon back into the app in late 2017/early 2018. This would be the icon prior to their 2018 redesign.

#### Uber Eats

![](https://elischiff.com/images/2018-10-10-UberEats@2x.webp)The Uber Eats icon trajectory. It’s not obvious, but Eat app (top row) is a different company entirely.
Also curious is the lack of public attention to the Uber Eats icon, which has had a similarly rough past several years. The Uber Eats icon started out as a stylized fork, but in December 2017, with little fanfare, Uber launched a new green version eerily similar to the pre-existing Eat app. Eat [publicly mocked Uber](https://www.facebook.com/eat.app.restaurant.reservations/photos/a.776333945777675/1534754123268983/?type=3&theater) about the icon similarities, and Eat designer Ismet Trako [contacted Uber](https://twitter.com/ismettrako/status/1039911395264028676) about the issue. Shortly after, Uber changed their icon, albeit only slightly. Uber would do so again prior to the 2018 rebrand.

Looking back on the February 2016 brand refresh, it’s funny to recall the [prediction](https://medium.com/@andrewcrow/moving-on-from-uber-3bac72fdf7bc) of then Head of Design at Uber, Andrew Crow, as he announced his departure from the company. In his announcement, referring to the centerpiece icon and brand, he said, “we created a beautiful new brand for the company that will lead us forward for years to come.” Replace “years” with ‘months,’ and Crow would’ve been spot on.

Looking at the discontinuity in Uber’s icons, one wonders what insecurity could have led to such results at one of the industry’s few design powerhouses?

#### Shaky Foundations

Much of the dysfunction of Uber’s design team has been explored in [Uber’s Atomic Meltdown](http://www.elischiff.com/blog/2016/2/16/ubers-atomic-meltdown), my criticism of the 2016 brand refresh. But in light of this major brand update, the story warrants an expansion.
