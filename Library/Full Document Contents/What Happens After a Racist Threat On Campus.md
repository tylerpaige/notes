On November 11, the Friday after Election Day, a group of black freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania received a set of disturbing notifications. Students were already drained from an exceptionally grim week that saw millions of Americans elect Donald Trump as the next president. An event that felt like blunt-force trauma to much of the country was still fresh that morning, when Penn students learned that they’d been added to several chats within the texting app GroupMe. In the chat rooms, anonymous individuals with usernames like “Daddy Trump” posted a series of racist messages, including “Heil Trump” and a calendar event that threatened a “daily lynching.”

Throughout the afternoon, Penn students shared screenshots of the GroupMe messages on Facebook, and news of the incident spread across campus by text. More than 161 people were [reportedly](http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20161112_Racist_messages_target_black_freshmen_at_UPenn_with__lynching_.html) part of the GroupMe, including the creators, though the exact number was hard to track. Calvary Rogers, a sophomore, says he found out about it after seeing a freshman friend—one of the GroupMe victims—“scared and shaking” in a classroom. Rogers joined the GroupMe so he could have evidence to report it to the Vice Provost office.

Across the country, a version of what Penn had experienced was playing out on various sinister levels, inspired in part by the racist rhetoric of our future president who, during his campaign, proposed a ban on Muslims in America, stereotyped Mexicans as rapists, and seemed to think all black Americans live in inner city slums. “The reality of a Trump America was hard in itself,” Rogers tells me over the phone. “For that incident to happen two days later, it was just like, wow, we haven’t even had a week and we’re already getting legit death threats. At that point, I realized the scale of this thing, and it really hit me how comfortable racist people had gotten.”

At 4 p.m., the student-run collective of black organizations on campus known as UMOJA (Swahili for “unity”) held an emergency town hall in the basement of Rodin College House. A mic was set up in the room, and students were encouraged to speak openly about the incident. This was their declared safe space. In the room, students expressed a mixture of fear, disgust, and confusion about being targets of cyber racism. “I don’t think anybody had a productive Friday,” says Araba Ankuma, a senior and creative fellow at Penn’s black student resource center Makuu who attended the town hall. “That’s how badly it affected the student psyche.”

Roughly two hours later, the meeting moved to a café in Huntsman Hall, where Penn president Amy Gutmann showed up to support the black students and allies in attendance. A mic was set up there, too, and the administration provided free food. Within 24 hours of the GroupMe incident, Penn Police were working with the FBI and Microsoft (which owns GroupMe) to identify three Oklahoma residents as the suspected creators of the GroupMe, including a male student at the University of Oklahoma. A spokesperson for Microsoft emailed me a statement that the company also sent to other media outlets: “As soon as we became aware of the chats taking place on GroupMe, which were in violation of our terms of service, we took action to remove the chats and suspend associated user accounts.”

Penn students weren’t the only targets of GroupMe threats that day. Students at Vanderbilt University in Nashville were also added to the same chats, according to reports. Over the phone, Vanderbilt senior and student body president Ariana Fowler tells me she saw GroupMe screenshots from peers on Facebook on the night of November 11, and that she reported the incident to the Dean of Students and the Vanderbilt Police Department. Fowler launched her own amateur investigation, circulating emails and screenshots on social media. She estimates that 10 to 15 black and Muslim Vanderbilt students were added to the GroupMe, based on responses and communication with school officials. Citing reactions on campus after Trump won, Fowler says, “We had a lot of issues with students not understanding why their peers were saying they were afraid. This incident made it a very real manifestation of those fears.”

In an email sent to students on Sunday, November 13 (and forwarded to me), Vanderbilt’s Dean’s office stated: “The University has received reports that some Vanderbilt students were added to a racist Group Me account. This account includes vicious, racist messages and images with degrading and brutally violent content.” The email added that Vanderbilt police were conducting an investigation, encouraged students to use the school’s resources and reinforced that “bias-related harassment, intimidation and threats have no place at Vanderbilt and are antithetical to the values of our academic community.” Unlike at Penn, the incident was not reported as a crime at Vanderbilt. In an emailed statement, a Vanderbilt press rep wrote to me: “Vanderbilt University Police Department currently has not received any reports from students indicating they were directly targeted by the GroupMe message. The university is aware of some students on our campus who appear to have been forwarded the message, but not directly targeted.”

Similarly, the Penn administration sent multiple memos to update students about the investigation. The students I spoke with were curious how outsiders were able to gain access to freshmen contacts. In a [memo](https://news.upenn.edu/latest-update-racist-messages-directed-penn-students) on November 15, Gutmann revealed that the University of Oklahoma student had accepted an offer to attend Penn but ultimately chose not to enroll. Because of this, he still had access to a contact list through a private Facebook group consisting of freshmen. Authorities believe the student, whose name hasn’t been released, used the freshmen list to compile the racist GroupMe chat.

In her memo, Gutmann reiterated the school’s support and announced that the University of Oklahoma student suspect had been suspended from his school (Penn Police crime logs show a November 11 incident reported as a “terroristic threat”). Some Penn students were impressed with the university’s swift action. “They offered a safe space for black students, they brought in a cyber team right away, and they had detectives right away,” says Rogers. Another student I spoke to was uncertain whether the response was largely due to heightened media attention. There were reporters and cameras on campus and people were watching. When news reached the city’s mayor Jim Kenney, he issued a [statement](http://www.fox29.com/news/216973420-story) calling the actions “disgusting” and wrote: “It is heartbreaking to see this type of activity here in the birthplace of our democracy and the city of brotherly love.”
