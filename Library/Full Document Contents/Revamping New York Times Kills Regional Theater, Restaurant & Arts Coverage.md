The *[New York Times](https://deadline.com/tag/new-york-times/)* this week quietly ended its coverage of restaurants, art galleries, theaters and other commercial and nonprofit businesses in the tri-state region, laying off dozens of longtime contributors and prompting protests from many of the institutions that will be affected. They foresee an impact not only on patronage but, in the case of the nonprofits, on their ability to raise funds to survive.

“For all of us in the arts, this decision is an unmitigated disaster,” Bram Lewis, artistic director of the Schoolhouse Theater in the Northern Westchester hamlet of Croton Falls, told Deadline in an email. “The Schoolhouse Theater has been reviewed by Times critics

>  **“For all of us in the arts, this decision is an unmitigated disaster,” says artistic director Bram Lewis. “Our record will be gone. The 50% jump in box office will be gone. The support in funding with a *Times* review will be gone.”**

Alvin Klein, David Dewitt and Sylviane Gold for more than 30 years, our record will be gone. The 50% jump in box office will be gone. The support in funding with a *Times* review will be gone, the ability to fund-raise, build a board and be recognized among peers for artistic excellence will be all but silenced.”

The change comes as the *NYT* revamps its coverage of several beats, from [Los Angeles](http://deadline.com/2016/08/new-york-times-to-rebuild-la-staff-1201801809/) to the New York metro region. When the paper announced this month it will no longer cover local fires and crimes, Public Editor Liz Spayd cautiously defended the decision, asking in her August 6 column, “Why should a newsroom that just announced lofty international ambitions spend resources covering news of no interest to readers in Beijing or London?”

Deadline has obtained an email dated August 2 from *Times* metropolitan editor Wendell Jamieson to more than two dozen freelance critics and reporters telling them their services would no longer be needed:

>  “Dean Baquet and I have decided that the resources and energy currently devoted to these local pages could be better directed elsewhere. Therefore, we will publish our final reviews and features in the New Jersey, Westchester, Long Island and Connecticut editions on August 28. The Metropolitan section as it appears in New York City will still be published and circulated throughout the region, but it will no longer include zoned content…Sorry about this, folks. I want to thank you for all you’ve done, all the fine writing you’ve given our readers. I wish you all the best.”
> 
>  

The effects of the layoffs extend beyond the contributors to the *Times*‘ local coverage. Over half the region’s population of 20.2 million people live in the New York, New Jersey and Connecticut suburbs. Businesses and nonprofits there, as in the city, rely heavily on *Times* coverage — not only as so many local news outlets have disappeared, but also because of the legitimacy a *Times* review or feature story confers.

“Long Island boasts one of the country’s most thriving restaurant communities outside of a major city,” says Ryan Sutton, the chief critic at influential food site Eater New York and a highly regarded tracker of the industry. “(Longtime reviewer) Joanne Starkey’s recommendations helped shape how Long Island eats. Every single Long Island restaurant worth its salt has a framed *New York Times* review hanging up in the foyer. Now millions of residents will have one less source of authority. And that’s no small matter, given that second-rate Long Island restaurants often charge as much as their NYC counterparts. Those restaurants need critical pushback.”

**The move also has heightened anxieties on the Times culture desk** that reassignments or cuts in the department’s full-time staff are imminent. Insiders have told Deadline that critics and reporters have been compelled to take crash courses in producing for the *Times* website, in the hopes that the culture report — in which the paper has a historically proprietary interest — increases online viewership. Efforts to make the culture report more reader friendly can be seen in the recent proliferation of stories in which top critics interview artists they or their colleagues cover. (Such features are a mainstay of most publications, but the *Times* has until now maintained a fairly impermeable wall between critics and the people they cover.)

The *Times* declined Deadline’s requests for comment from metropolitan editor Jamieson and culture editor Danielle Mattoon. (Disclosure: I was a reporter and columnist for the *Times* from 1986-1991.) Danielle Rhoades Ha, the paper’s VP Communications, told Deadline that “the training you mention in your email below is happening across the newsroom and is not unique to any desk.”

The New York suburbs are home to much of the city’s cultural elite, some of whom also are angered by the cessation of local coverage. Mark Lamos, a director with major credits in the theater and opera worlds, is also the artistic director of the Westport Country Playhouse, a venerated nonprofit favored by neighbors Joanne Woodward and the late Paul Newman, among many other well-known artists, and a producer of shows that occasionally landed on Broadway.

“The impact is profound,” Lamos told Deadline in an email. “Our audience relies on the *Times* to bring them up-to-date cultural news. We have a vital and robust theater scene that has been in the forefront of the American nonprofit theater movement for years, not to mention great restaurants, important museums and musical performances of rare distinction. Why let your readership down? I find it inexplicable. Money, I guess.”

The economic impact of a *Times* review isn’t news — but the loss of those reviews will be felt by those commercial and nonprofit businesses. Chef and restaurateur Greg Grossman recently opened Oreya in tony Southampton on Long Island’s East End, where *Times* readers are wont to summer. Oreya earned a glowing review from freelance reviewer Kurt Wenzel, who waxed especially fond of the branzino. The stamp of approval was immediately felt.

“There’s no more coveted review than the *New York Times*,” Grossman told Deadline in a telephone interview. “We opened at the half-season with no street sign, and most locals didn’t even know we existed until the *Times* review came out. The weekday impact was instant. We went from about 50 people in the dining room on Wednesday and Thursday nights to 150. And they ordered three times more branzino than before the review. People rely on those reviews.”

In making the changes on the Metro desk, the *Times* said its reasons were structural and philosophical, not economic (an argument that caused even the Public Editor to raise an eyebrow). And it’s hard to imagine, given the pittance freelancers are typically paid by the *Times*, that laying off a couple of dozen writers will save buckets of money. But the impact on the businesses they cover, and the watchdog role that the *Times* plays in so many other areas, is likely to be felt throughout the region populated by the paper’s most loyal readers and advertisers.

Wenzel was philosophical about being given the boot. “This is, in my opinion, the real shame of ending this part of the Metro section (beyond the livelihood of writers),” he wrote in an email. “The fact that there is now much less oversight of local culture and entertainment. Local communities are the biggest losers, since a new theater run or restaurant won’t get the opportunity to reach the sophisticated audience that the *Times* attracts.”

Schoolhouse Theater’s Bram Lewis is less sanguine about the loss of *Times* reviews. “It’s a stunningly wrong decision,” he said. “When the Paper of Record no longer sees a need to *record*, we are stranded. Close to half the Sunday *Times* [readership] is in the regions, and they all jump to their local pages first. It took decades to win such loyalty.”

* The Sunday Metropolitan section has turned into a big nothing without any regional news, especially restaurants. There are places to eat in the area that are not in Manhattan & Brooklyn. And your readers live in those places. The local news had to go, but not the boring details of a Sunday routine from somebody we mostly have never heard of?
* The only reason I subscribe to the Times is for the dance coverage. It’s not a threat, it’s just the truth. There wouldn’t be any reason for me to subscribe to a New York paper since I live closer to L.A. if not for the excellent dance writing.
* My husband wrote for the Westchester section of the Times for over 13 years, back when the writing for the regionals was done by people who actually lived in the region and who had a physical office there to Write. When the paper started trimming costs by closing the regional offices and trimming staff, they came up with the bright idea to assign Manhattan-based young reporters to cover the regions. These reporters, mostly new and looking to make a name for themselves, hated it. Their writing reflected a lack of understanding of the communities. You can only “phone it in” for so long before people realize that their news has second class status. When the Times cut even closer to the bone, local news and reviews were relegated to a few pages in the back of the Metro section, compounding the lack of concern for readers. Those of us once associated with the regionals have known that it was a matter of time before the Times euthanized them…. Or should I say, the Manhattan Times.
* Instead of arts organizations focusing on a business decision by a media company over which they have no control, better they should focus on shedding the sense of entitlement harbored all these years by imprudently relying on a single periodical to function virtually as their in-house publicity arm, let alone assigning to the Times the role of third-party fundraising facilitator. That is not the function of media. Orchestrating and ensuring publicity is the responsibility of those covered, not the obligation of media that assigns and publishes the coverage. For arts groups not to have cultivated other channels of marketing through the years that they can directly manage is their faux pas to own; it’s the equivalent of a supplier of goods relying on a single large customer for its viability and profitability. Leaving your financial health exposed like that is a cardinal sin of a for-profit or a not-for-profit enterprise. Let this turn of events serve as a wake-up call to arts groups to build their own marketing machine, even banding together to achieve strength in numbers. Other regions have done that, with positive outcomes.
* As executive director of a small non- profit arts organization in the lower Hudson Valley, I find this decision very disappointing, but not surprising. I know it must’ve been difficult for those editors to lay off writers, who probably are struggling to get work. Clearly, becoming an international paper is an attempt to save the paper. And perhaps it will. It will just no longer be “our” paper, the paper that all New Yorkers take pride in. There are so many of us in the Hudson Valley who buy the NYT just for the regional news of cultural events that are an easy day trip for city dwellers and those of us who live within an hour or so radius. The other stuff can be easily found online. Goodbye, NYT. I will miss Sunday morning coffee with you.
* I just read the Public Editor, Liz Spayd’s, commentary on The Times’ new approach to local news, and she makes a lot of good points in its explanation and defense. It all depends upon how it’s executed. But I disagree with dropping all the regional reviews.
* To paraphrase Woody Allen, “you can be an intellectual and still not have a clue”. It’s not so much that the decision by the Times is a short-sighted, dunderhead move (which it is). What makes this so ironic, is the outrage on Deadline Hollywood. 

 How is this decision by the NYT different from the realities of present day filmmaking? The last time I looked, it appears that ALL decisions – from casting to story ideas to the simplicity of scripts to location shooting to distribution emanates by what is popular in Hong Kong, Bombay, Mexico, etc. Meaning the foreign markets dictate the same new world that the Times and all media lives in. 

 Why would any of you be so surprised?
* You have the NY Daily News to cover local fires and crime stories, and suburban papers to cover suburban restaurants and theater. As a non-NY reader of the NYT, I look to it for top-notch reporting on national and international stories, while also giving me features and reviews on the very best of the culture, dining and entertainmetn scenes in NYC (not suburban Connecticut or NJ). To me, this is a smart move, and I applaud them for focusing on what differentiates the NYT and makes it special.
* I was going to try to sound articulate, erudite etc. in my response to this story, but all intellectual capabilities have deserted me. I can only say this is absolutely the most catastrophically bad decision ever made by the NYT. The reason stated is a new “philosophy?” What a crock and an insult to think readers are going to believe that. Why don’t you just tell the truth NYT…..it’s about money. Well, so long to my favorite paper, and my condolences to the cultural and cuisine communities that this will affect negatively in NYC.
* The person quoted saying that this was all about money is perfectly right. The Times needs it, and all the businesses that are complaining about its cessation of coverage might ask themselves how much advertising they placed with the Times, and all the readers who are complaining might ask themselves whether they are 7-day a week subscribers…..that said, I hope to God that the Times doesn’t axe the New York City art, theater, music and other cultural critics….that really would leave a gaping hole in their coverage — and their reputation!
