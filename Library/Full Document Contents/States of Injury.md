Summary: Wendy Brown discusses how liberalism creates an idea of an independent, self-interested person, but this idea depends on others being seen as dependent. She explains that struggles for freedom can both empower and limit people because rights can protect but also control marginalized groups. Brown urges us to keep questioning how rights and freedom work in society, especially for those who are excluded or oppressed.
