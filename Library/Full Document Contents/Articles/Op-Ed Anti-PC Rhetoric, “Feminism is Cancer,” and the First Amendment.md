Tuesday’s student protest of Milo Yiannopoulos’ “Feminism is Cancer” event has been reductively charged with devaluing free speech. The issue is far more complex than that. The defense of protest is at the essay’s end, but I encourage you to consider it in its totality.

Imagine a high-level calculus lecture conducted with disregard to the rules and language of calculus. The lecturer has replaced numerals and variables with [wingdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wingdings#/media/File:Wingdings.png), and confuses antidifferentiation with differentiation. Or imagine an architecture lecturer pointing to a window and calling it a “glass-filled wall-hole,” and a column a “stone trunk.” And imagine an ethnographic census that groups citizens by racial epithets.

Every field of study, whether STEM or humanities, is grounded in a linguistic foundation, laboriously set by scholars and always subject to scrupulous internal revision. Gender studies and queer theory are not exempt from this; they are not trivial fads with loosely defined lexicons; they are legitimate academic endeavors centuries in the making. Undervaluations of their veracity and place have arisen largely because these fields have only recently, in the late 20th century, spread to societal consciousness, which tends to react adversely to any disruption of comfortable assumptions. The public is liable to misunderstand new theories on gender and sexuality because the complex language they employ is diluted when detached from the comprehensive totality of original texts. Moreover, the meticulous attention new theory devotes to unpacking historically narrow definitions (e.g. ‘gender’ and ‘sexuality’) is seen as obtuse nitpicking rather than a truly viable reanalysis.

Now, replace those imagined lecture scenarios with a real one, in which feminism (an academic discipline with adjacent social movements) is discussed only with vulgarities and coarsely misappropriated terms. This was the caliber of Milo Yiannopoulos’ “Feminism is Cancer” talk at UCLA on Tuesday, May 31. Its title alone implies not an academic debate but a violent eradication of ‘metastasized’ thought. Yet the event’s organizers, the Bruin Republicans, [billed it](https://www.facebook.com/events/253819344970893/) as part of their commitment to “encouraging ideological diversity and promoting thoughtful debate on campus.” Should this prefatory disclaimer excuse the talk’s callous and incendiary language? For your consideration I have selected a couple Yiannopoulos quotes from the night’s hideous heap, barely paraphrased and without excision of expletives:

But with blatant hypocrisy he accuses the left of “shaming, name-calling, silencing, bullying, and nannying.” So the “thoughtful debate” was in effect a sophist’s orgy of ad hominem complaints. Of course, this is Yiannopoulos’ platform: the absolute rejection of political correctness (PC) by absurd and provocative defiance. I recognize that many liberal and conservatives alike interpret political correctness as a tyrannical imposition on the First Amendment. People, understandably, do not like to have their values questioned and they do not like to be told what they should say. When intellectuals are the ones questioning values and pushing for progressive linguistic change, people are even less happy because they perceive it as belittling condescension. Admittedly, professional intellectuals occupy a privileged position in the United States, and so people without the most advanced (and expensive) education should never be expected to show them subservience. But political correctness is not enslaving anyone to pedants. It is better defined (and this is what I mean when I use it) as a responsible acknowledgement of historical transgressions and persisting social inequalities through word choice at the minimum. Thoroughly informed language is the first step in all progress. Rabidly anti-PC rhetoric precludes receptivity to non-normative language and thus erects an impenetrable wall of ignorance and apathy. I want to be clear that I am not criticizing it for failure to conform to some kind of social justice dogma; I am criticizing its embrace of linguistic violence and its disregard for nuanced thought. As Eve Sedgwick more elaborately states in “Queer and Now,” anti-PC rhetoric broadly attempts to

In short, with the pretext of preventing ‘oppressive’ impositions, it reinforces myopic conventions. This is the case not only with Yiannopoulos but *South Park*’s characterization of “PC Principal” as the stereotypical social justice ‘bro.’ While the show may have some claim to address imperious instances of PC enforcement, it glosses over larger pertinent issues with the same blasé demeanor as Yiannopoulos. Both lionize abrasive humor as a potent critical tool. The loyal audiences are conditioned to adopt this humor in their social and political lives, and its inherent disdain for any discourse not marked by scorn and self-regard debars their potential for open mindedness. Here *South Park* is mild compared Yiannopoulos, whose Youtube live-feed comment section mirrors his speech more explicitly but with comparable maliciousness:

Note the similarity of these comments to the vitriol that passes for truth in the anonymous forums of *4chan*. Its connection to [a recent mass shooting](http://www.nytimes.com/live/shooting-at-umpqua-community-college/explaining-4chan/) evidences how hatred on the web may spill into reality. The violence Yiannopoulos incites has up to this point been limited to the realm of language: he is incontrovertibly a proponent of hate speech*.* He is an unfortunate proponent of the First Amendment, which can never be legally abused but can legally be an implement of verbal abuse (a real form of abuse). His use for legality, however, ends here. In the talk he follows his endorsement of Donald Trump with the triumphant guarantee: “you’ll be able to say, do, and feel whatever you want!” Exaggerated, but telling nonetheless. Yiannopoulos supports Trump because he wants to ‘liberate’ us from ‘compulsive’ morality.

Hopefully I have constructed a tenable argument so far; now I want to exonerate the anti-Milo protest. Two criticisms have been leveled at those involved:

Regarding the second point, the organizers never intended for this event to be a “thoughtful” and “diverse” discussion, despite their assertions. Look into Yiannopoulos’ history and you will notice the pattern: he riles people up and shuts them down not with rational debate but with disparaging insults. When faced with disagreeable questions he can do nothing but laugh, shrug, and allude to vague, sensational claims. Or he [does nothing at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFys6b4NXNU). Accordingly, protesters did not prepare for the futile and tedious task of calm counterargument; and surely they did not expect resistance to change the minds of bigots. The gathering was a conscious refusal to be baited with promises of academic dialogue into a trap of certain hate and a reminder that the fallacy of misplaced scale elevates obvious slander to an academic level at which it cannot contribute. No more than supple compliance could disregard have made this statement; nonchalance is certainly not listed alongside ethics, excellence, work, and commitment in the [True Bruin Values](http://www.truebruin.ucla.edu/). The appeals for ‘respectable’ debate and casual indifference invoke a notion of dignity too disconnected from the political arena to have any real effect. *Decorous* responses, perhaps, but merely postured retreat, a la Yiannopoulos. It delivered these messages to him, and more importantly it questioned UCLA’s sanctioning of the event.

I understand how conflicted the administration is, obliged by the First Amendment to protect even the most puerile, apolitical platforms. But when true hate, flying under the guise of political discourse, is given an auditorium and fair consideration, it is also authorized to degrade the integrity of our academic community. On this same premise, no white supremacist group would be accepted. Yiannopoulos’ political popularity and ‘respectable’ affiliations should not be allowed to mask the patent parallels between his vile rhetoric and that of organizations with only slightly more transparent agendas of hatred. The administration has called them distinct and leaned on the excuse of legality, which we can view alternatively as a feeble crutch or infallible pillar. Neither viewpoint will alter the Constitution and, as the 80’s and 90’s have shown, we cannot legally bar hate speech from campus without winding up at the Supreme Court. Perhaps through instances like “Feminism is Cancer” the law’s shortcomings embolden us––this event has in fact generated at least *latent* academic discussion to reaffirm and bolster progressive movements, and importantly it has shown the full but manageable extent to which Donald Trump’s pernicious populism threatens UCLA. Hence I will not end with condemnation, bitterness, or indecision, but rather encouragement. As student protesters we proclaim our voice louder and more human by inconveniently existing in a space where the law must permit hateful assembly and speech; where the law does not immediately advocate for the virtues of language and education, we must.
