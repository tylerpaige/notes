When Dr. Jennifer Girard walked into the darkened room, her first thought was that the 61-year-old man looked too healthy to be in the hospital. It was well past midnight, and though his pale blue eyes had the puffiness of fatigue, he was awake and alert.

She introduced herself to her newest patient. She was a resident finishing up her second year of training and was caring for the patients who came in that night.

#### **A Sudden Fever**

He sat up, put on his glasses and explained why he had come to the hospital. He’d just returned home to Boston from a weeklong trip to Edinburgh. Once back, his co-worker, a young woman half his age, developed a horrible stomach illness — lots of pain and diarrhea — that kept her home for the next two days. But he’d felt fine.

Around the time she was starting to feel better, he woke up feeling tired and achy. A museum curator, he was leading a group that day to a nearby town to view a collection, and he thought he could manage. But that afternoon, on the way home in the tour bus, he began to shiver. He went home and got into bed. He dug up a thermometer and stuck it under his tongue. It read 101.

The next day he was too sick to work. He was expecting that he had the same stomach bug his co-worker had. But though his stomach felt tender, the violent symptoms never arrived. He just felt feverish and sore. When his temperature rose to 103 the following day, he called his doctor’s office and went in the next afternoon. He was still blazing with fever, and the doctor sent him to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.

#### **The Danger of a Helpful Drug**

In the E.R., he was given high-dose acetaminophen to bring his fever down. And he spent the rest of the day being questioned, prodded, poked and scanned. None of the tests were revealing, but no one wanted to send him home, either. He understood why. For the past two years, he’d been taking a medication called etanercept for Sjogren’s syndrome. The drug works by tamping down the immune system, and that limited his ability to fight off infections.

Sjogren’s is an autoimmune disorder — a somewhat mysterious type of disease in which the body’s own white blood cells attack normal tissue as if it were an invading organism — in this case wreaking havoc on the glands that make tears and saliva, as well as on some of the joints. A weekly injection of etanercept had been helpful, eliminating his joint pain. But he knew that because of this drug, he was almost helpless in the face of a serious infection.

Once the acetaminophen kicked in, the patient felt much better. The E.R. doctors decided to admit him overnight. If, as the doctors suspected, he had a virus, he’d be fine the next day and could go home.

#### **In Search of Infections**

When Girard first heard about her new patient, she read up on the infections to which people who took etanercept were susceptible. It was a long list. Viruses couldn’t be treated before diagnosis, so she focused on bacterial infections. One bacterium that attacks those with immune deficiencies is food-borne and called listeria. It is often found in unpasteurized milk and cheeses and tends to cause horrible nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, which he didn’t have. Legionella pneumonia is another infection more common in those who take the medication, but he didn’t have a cough and wasn’t short of breath. A much more common bug, staph aureus, could cause joint infections — though again, he didn’t have any complaints about his joints.

Still, she planned to start him on broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover all these threats. But when she met him, he didn’t look like someone who had a terrible infection. The doctors in the E.R. hadn’t given him antibiotics. She could hold off on the antibiotics and just watch and wait — but if he had one of the infections she’d read about, delaying treatment even a few hours could be deadly. To make matters more complicated, he thought he was allergic to penicillin — though he couldn’t remember what happened when he took it. This shifted the risk-benefit ratio. The normally low-stakes decision of whether to start an antibiotic changed when doing so could be so dangerous.

She asked a colleague, another resident, to assess the patient. Girard didn’t tell her co-worker that she planned on an antibiotic; she just asked her to see the patient and give a recommendation. The co-worker saw the patient and agreed. Even though he looked well, if he had an infection, he was practically defenseless against it. She should give him the antibiotics.

#### **A New Fever**

Because he had a history of a penicillin allergy, Girard would have to test him to make sure he could tolerate the medication, which was not penicillin but a close cousin. Girard ordered a test dose to be given. If he was going to have a serious reaction to the medicine, he would have a rash or his blood pressure would drop. Neither happened. So he got the full dose.

A couple of hours later, Girard got a call. The patient had spiked a temperature of 102. She ran down to see him. His face was shiny with a thin layer of sweat, and his cheeks were rosy. And though he looked uncomfortable, his heart and blood pressure were fine. Thank goodness she’d given him antibiotics, she thought to herself. She ordered another dose of Tylenol, and when she came back for one final look at him, he was sound asleep. His temperature was gone. The sweaty gleam and rosy cheeks had disappeared.

#### **An Answer Emerges**

The next night, when Girard returned to the hospital for her overnight shift, the first thing she did was check on this patient. She had admitted five other patients, but he was the one she worried about from home after signing him over to the day team. In the hours since she last saw him, his blood had grown an organism in the lab. It was too early to know precisely what it was. But it was clear that it was bacteria robust enough to grow quickly in a petri dish and that it wasn’t staph aureus or Legionella. The list of other possibilities was long, and none really seemed to fit.

It was another two days before they could finally identify the bug. It was listeria. Girard — and just about everyone caring for the man — was surprised. As a physician, you get these pictures in your head about diseases. For Girard, listeriosis was a disease that you got from unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses and that caused nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. She did a little more reading on the unusual infection and found that while people with normal immune systems may experience these symptoms, they usually recover quickly, like the patient’s co-worker. In pregnant women, people over 65 or anyone with an impaired immune system, however, the infection can break out of the digestive tract — sometimes without manifesting the typical symptoms — and get into the bloodstream. From there it can spread like wildfire through the entire body.

This form of the infection, called invasive listeriosis, can be fatal up to 30 percent of the time in these patients. Indeed, though less common than botulism, listeriosis can be just as deadly. Early treatment with antibiotics can be lifesaving.

If this was a food-borne illness, which food had carried the bacteria? Though the man and his co-worker did not have unpasteurized milk or soft cheese on their trip, an internet search showed an outbreak of listeria this summer in Scotland linked to smoked beef. Neither of them had eaten smoked beef, but they had shared some smoked salmon. Exactly where they’d picked up the bug remained a mystery.

Once the medical team knew what he had, they could tailor the antibiotics. He completed his three-week treatment in July. His doctors instructed him to take it easy for the rest of the summer, but at this point he feels mostly back to normal and has returned to his museum and the work he loves.
