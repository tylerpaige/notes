- Summary: The book "Uncorporate Identity" critiques how modern design has become dull and controlled by branding, losing its original creativity. The Cooper-Hewitt museum's exhibition "Why Design Now?" shows how design can solve big global problems but feels too serious and cautious. Both works explore the search for meaning in design during difficult times, but they offer very different views and approaches.

NEW YORK — On one page of the book is a painting of the sun in red, yellow and black, the colors of the Spanish flag. It was given to his country as a gift by the artist Joan Miró to be the symbol for what would become a stunningly successful tourism campaign. (Just as well — the government design team had suggested sombreros.)

Squeezed onto another page are some of the tourism logos from other countries, which were (let’s say) “inspired” by Miró’s sun. Armenia. Azerbaijan. Bulgaria. Croatia. Greece. Holland. Maldives. Malta. Poland. Turkey. They’ve all tried to woo tourists with their own versions. (Although in Poland’s defense, it chose a valley, tree and river as its motifs, rather than pretending to be sunny.)

What do the copycat symbols have in common? A telltale whiff of Miró’s design, obviously, but something else too, according to the book “Uncorporate Identity” edited by the London-based cultural theorist Marina Vishmidt with Vinca Kruk, Daniel van der Velden and Gon Zifroni of Metahaven, a design research group located in Amsterdam and Brussels. “The various adaptations lacked the artistic signature that had made the original stand out,” the book concluded. “In trying to repeat and systematize the initial success, the ‘spontaneous gesture’ had become increasingly steered by the invisible hand of the branding industry.” What’s the result? Drearily derivative design.

And that’s only part of the problem. Described by its editors as “partially science-fiction story, equally strategic study, essay, comic and sketchbook” and “a concept album of design and architecture,” “Uncorporate Identity” questions the purpose and value of design in a neurotic and treacherous era of geopolitical instability, economic recession, environmental crisis, cultural and moral confusion.

Sounds grim? That’s the point. Like past Metahaven projects, “Uncorporate Identity” tries to redefine design for a dystopian era. Its heroes are Archigram, Constant Nieuwenhuys, Superstudio and other 1960s architectural fantasists. The villains are Modernist idols, like the late Paul Rand, whose iconic corporate identities included Enron’s.

Smart contextual essays by Ms. Vishmidt are animated by Metahaven’s visual experiments. There is a hilarious analysis of the branding potential of Sealand, a rusting concrete platform in the North Sea, originally built as a British defense fortress during World War II, and now an independent principality. Even funnier is a discourse on the increasingly illegible logos of black metal bands.

It’s tempting to cast “Uncorporate Identity” as the design world’s answer to “You Are Not A Gadget,” the critique of Web 2.0 technology’s “mash-up” culture in which the American technologist Jaron Lanier describes how “chats” with Facebook “friends” now pass for emotional exchanges and human tragedy can be distilled into the 140 characters of a Tweet. Cynical, acerbic and irreverent though both books are, their underlying message is an old-fashioned quest for meaning.

That quest is the theme of another new design project “National Design Triennial: Why Design Now?,” an exhibition which opened Friday at the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York. It poses the same question as “Uncorporate Identity,” but answers it very differently.

The fourth of the triennials, which present the Cooper-Hewitt’s take on recent developments in design, “Why Design Now?” is the first to do so globally, rather than nationally. It focuses on two of the most dynamic areas of contemporary design — tackling humanitarian and environmental problems. Among the challenges listed in the catalogue are: “How can we power the world with clean energy? How can we move people and products more safely and efficiently? How can we shelter communities in safe, sustainable environments? How can we enable people around the world to share and generate wealth?”

While “Uncorporate Identity” wallows in the complexities of such issues, “Why Design Now?” suggests possible design solutions. Sometimes they are made to seem a little too neat, especially at such a tumultuous time, and for anyone braving the political minefields of economic development and sustainability. Though no one could sensibly argue that the Cooper-Hewitt hasn’t chosen important challenges, or grouch about its celebrating, say, the greening of the once-stricken Colombian city of Medellín, the invention of clean energy sources and the work of humanitarian design volunteer networks.

If there’s a problem with “Why Design Now?,” it is one that has cursed the Cooper-Hewitt for years: earnestness. (And by that I mean that it is a little too dry, too cautious, too back-to-school.) Now, I know there are worse failings for museums (and earnestness can be considered a virtue) but, personally, I don’t think it’s the best way to enthuse people about as mercurial a medium as design.

It’s easy to see why the Cooper-Hewitt has chosen to play safe. One problem is its uneasy relationship with its “owner,” the redoubtable Smithsonian Institution, which has many merits, but no discernible passion for design. To make matters worse, the Cooper-Hewitt has seemed equally intimidated by both its designation, as the National Design Museum, and building, a magnificent Upper East Side mansion built in 1903 as the home of the robber baron, Andrew Carnegie.

There’s an identity crisis too. Apparently unable to decide whether to be a museum of design or the decorative arts, the Cooper-Hewitt has lacked the chutzpah to embrace both roles. Then there are its scary neighbors. The Museum of Modern Art’s collection is stronger on design, and the Metropolitan Museum’s on the decorative arts. MoMA has also trounced it intellectually by staging seminal design shows like 2008’s “Design and the Elastic Mind,” which aired some of the themes in “Why Design Now?,” but more feistily and playfully.

None of these problems are insoluble, and the Cooper-Hewitt is preparing to tackle them under a new director, the gifted and genial industrial designer Bill Moggridge. Unfair though it is to compare a cheeky gang of indie design conceptualists to a historic institution burdened by the Cooper-Hewitt’s responsibilities, a swashbuckling dose of Metahaven’s irreverence wouldn’t go amiss.
