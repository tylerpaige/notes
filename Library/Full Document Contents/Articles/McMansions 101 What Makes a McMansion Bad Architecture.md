- Summary: McMansions are often poorly designed because they lack balance, proportion, and rhythm in their architecture. They typically have an overwhelming number of secondary masses and voids, which makes them look disorganized and unattractive. Understanding basic architectural concepts can help distinguish between a well-designed house and a McMansion.

[[McMansion Hell - McMansions 101: What Makes a McMansion Bad Architecture?]]

***

Sometimes people ask, why is xyz house bad? Asking this question does not imply that the asker has bad taste or no taste whatsoever - it means that they are simply not educated in basic architectural concepts. In this post, I will introduce basic architectural concepts and explain why not all suburban/exurban/residential houses are McMansions, as well as what makes a McMansion especially hideous.

**Disclaimer:** These same principles do not always apply to Modernist or even canonically Postmodern architecture. These principles are for the classical or traditional architecture most residential homes are modeled after.

#### **Design Principle #1: Masses & Voids**

The *mass* is the largest portion of a building. Individual masses become interesting when they are combined together to form a façade. The arrangement of these shapes to create *weight* is called *massing*. As the pieces are combined, they are divided into categories: *primary* and *secondary* masses (1).

The *primary mass* is the largest shape in the building block. The *secondary masses* are the additional shapes that form the façade of a building.

Windows, doors, or other openings are called *voids*. Voids allow creation of negative space that allow for breaks within masses. Placing voids that allow for natural breaks in the mass create balance and rhythm across the building’s elevation.

**The secondary masses should never compete with the primary mass.**   

For example: an oversized projected entry or portico (secondary mass) will overwhelm the house (primary mass) behind it.   

**The McMansion has no concept of mass.**   

McMansions often have so many secondary masses that the primary mass is reduced to a role of filling in gaps between the secondary masses. An example:

Another issue with McMansions and mass is the **use of too many voids**. Some McMansions are so guilty of this they resemble swiss cheese in appearance. In the below example, the masses are so pockmarked with voids, they give the façade an overall appearance of emptiness.

#### **Design Principle #2: Balance**

*Balance* is the relationship among the parts of a building on either side of an imaginary centerline through the middle of the house. Houses can be *symmetrically* or *asymmetrically* balanced.

In a *symmetrically balanced* house, the shapes on one side of the centerline match the shapes on the other side. The two halves are visually equal, as seen in the example below.

In an *asymmetrically balanced* house, the shapes may not match exactly, but instead have **equal visual weight** they are still visually balanced.

Another example:

**McMansions have notoriously poor balance. See the example below:**

In this design, one can barely tell where the line of symmetry is to be drawn due to the conflicting rooflines and architectural elements. Another example, where the line of symmetry is difficult to distinguish:

#### **Design Principle #3: Proportion**

*Proportion* refers to the relationships of one part of a façade to the whole. A house that is correctly proportionate establishes a visual relationship between all parts of its exterior. The voids, primary, and secondary masses should all be proportional to one another in order maintain architectural harmony.

This is an example of a properly proportioned house:

Another common feature of proportionate houses is that they abide by the ubiquitous Rule of Thirds. Below is an example of a simple suburban house, whose proportions properly follow this rule:

![image](https://64.media.tumblr.com/81aefe2828135d28d0132ecd494fb0ff/tumblr_inline_obrdudCV3J1sppt0x_540.png)
**McMansions are horrible at proportions.** Just look at this example, which completely lacks proportional harmony:

#### **Design Principle #4: Rhythm**

*Rhythm* in architecture describes the use of repetitive elements in order to establish architectural harmony. It is based off of **three main principles**: the principle of **Proximity,** the principle of **Similarity,** and the principle of **Continuation***.* These principles are part of a larger set known as *Gestalt Principles.* 

The principle of *proximity* states that objects that are close together should complement each other. This is the same principle that has us grouping four windows in two groups of two, rather than as four individuals. This colonial revival house properly demonstrates the principle of proximity:

The principle of *similarity* refers to how our eyes are easily able to group objects together that share common textures, colors, or features. A house demonstrates *clutter* by having too many shapes, too much variety, or seems generally disorganized. The same image as above also demonstrates the principle of similarity:

![image](https://64.media.tumblr.com/8ab87e145a165fb05da5093f4fc07e5c/tumblr_inline_obrdufkLT61sppt0x_500.png)
The principle of *continuation* refers to how the eye will move along a path in given direction until it reaches a final point. This is a useful tool in creating movement. In our colonial revival house, continuation is revealed through certain architectural details:

![image](https://64.media.tumblr.com/4dbc079d6932b3fcfef4d4694742a38c/tumblr_inline_obrdugaifW1sppt0x_500.png)
**McMansions lack architectural rhythm.** This is one of the easiest ways to determine between a McMansion and a, well, mansion. Here is an example of a house with terrible rhythm. On the example below, **none of the main windows match any of the other main windows**. The contrasting materials distract the eye from an otherwise somewhat asymmetrically balanced (if massive) house. The inconsistency of the window shapes as well as the shutters make this house incredibly tacky.

This rounds up post #1 of McMansions 101 - but don’t worry, there are many more factors that make an otherwise normal suburban house a McMansion, and each will be covered in their own special posts.
