#### Plot

Pat, Sam, Reece and Tiger are members of a punk band, the Ain't Rights, travelling through the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest). After their gig is cancelled, a local radio host, Tad, arranges a show through his cousin, Daniel, at a [neo-Nazi skinhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-Nazi_skinhead) bar in the woods outside Portland, opening for the [Nazi metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_metal) band Cowcatcher.

After the show, Pat returns to the [green room](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_room) to retrieve Sam's phone. He sees the body of a woman, Emily, who has been stabbed to death by Werm, a member of Cowcatcher. Pat calls the police, but the bar employees Gabe and Big Justin confiscate the band's phones and hold them captive in the green room. Gabe pays a skinhead to stab another to create a cover story for the police who respond to the call. He consults with the bar owner and skinhead leader, Darcy, who decides to kill the band to eliminate witnesses.

The band overpowers Big Justin and holds him hostage, taking a boxcutter from his pocket and his pistol. They negotiate through the door with Darcy, who asks them to surrender the pistol. Pat agrees, but as he opens the door, Emily's friend Amber realizes it is a trap. Darcy and his men slash at Pat's arm and partially sever his hand with machetes until he drops the gun, but he closes the door. Big Justin attacks the band, but Reece chokes him into unconsciousness. When Big Justin surprises Reece by awaking again, Reece chokes Big Justin again and Amber cuts him with a boxcutter to confirm that he is dead.

Searching for a way out, the band discovers an underground drug lab, but the only exit is locked from the outside. Arming themselves with improvised weapons, they exit the green room into the empty club. A skinhead, Clark, unleashes an attack dog, which kills Tiger. Amber and Pat drive the dog away with microphone feedback. Reece flees through a window but is hacked to death by a skinhead.

Pat, Amber, and Sam retreat to the green room. Darcy sends Daniel into the club to kill the band, who Darcy claims murdered Emily. Amber tells Daniel that Werm murdered Emily after discovering Daniel and Emily planned to leave the skinheads. Daniel agrees to help them escape and leads the band into the club, where he is shot dead by the bartender. The group kills the bartender and takes his shotgun, but Clark's dog kills Sam. Darcy's men wound Amber, who scrambles back to the green room with Pat.

Darcy sends the skinheads Jonathan and Kyle to kill Pat and Amber, and he leaves with the bodies, planning to stage their deaths to appear as if they were killed trespassing. Pat lures Jonathan into the drug lab while Kyle remains in the green room. Amber ambushes Kyle and cuts his throat with the boxcutter. As Pat fights Jonathan, Amber sneaks up and shoots him. Later Gabe surrenders to Pat and Amber.

Holding Gabe at gunpoint, the group trek through the woods. When Pat hears Darcy and his men staging the crime scene, he and Amber go after them. Gabe volunteers to go into a farm and call the police. Pat and Amber kill Clark and another skinhead. Fleeing, Darcy pulls a revolver from his jacket but is shot dead by Pat and Amber. The movie ends as Pat and Amber sit on the side of the road, waiting for the police.

#### Production

The film came from Saulnier's desire to create a thriller set in a green room, calling the idea "an obsession".[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-slashfilmfirstpage-11) Saulnier created a short film set in one as part of a 48-hour film challenge in 2007 which involved the [supernatural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernatural) and according to Saulnier was "Really kind of fun and hammy." However, he still wanted a chance to do his green room movie "the right way".[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-slashfilmfirstpage-11) Although the film features a large amount of violence and what Saulnier calls "full frontal gore", he has gone on record as stating that it is not "sadistic", and that every act of violence apart from the initiating incident is done with a reason.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-slashfilmpagetwo-12) As such Saulnier made sure that there were no "gratuitous close ups" of recently deceased characters.[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-slashfilmpagetwo-12)

On May 22, 2014, it was announced that [Broad Green Pictures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broad_Green_Pictures) would finance and produce the film directed and written by Jeremy Saulnier, with Film Science.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-BroadGreenPictures-13) Anish Savjani, [Neil Kopp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Kopp) and Victor Moyers would produce the film.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-BroadGreenPictures-13) On October 16, [Anton Yelchin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Yelchin) and [Imogen Poots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imogen_Poots) joined the lead cast of the film, along with [Alia Shawkat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alia_Shawkat), [Callum Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Turner), [Joe Cole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Cole_(actor)), Macon Blair and [Mark Webber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Webber_(actor)).[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-14) On October 21, [Patrick Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Stewart) was added to the cast to play Darcy Banker, the leader of a violent [white supremacist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_supremacist) group,[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-TheWrap-15) while other cast includes Kai Lennox, [Eric Edelstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Edelstein) and Taylor Tunes.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-TheWrap-15)

##### Filming

[Principal photography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_photography) began in October 2014 in [Portland, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon).[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-17) The location for Tad's house was in [Astoria, Oregon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astoria,_Oregon), on the Oregon coast, and the forest scenes were filmed in the [Mount Hood National Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Hood_National_Forest).[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-18) Filming concluded in late November 2014.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-19)

##### Music

Saulnier, who used to play in a [hardcore punk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardcore_punk) band called No Turn on Fred,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-20) wanted the film to "stand the test of real musicians scrutinizing every frame".[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-21) He enlisted [Hutch Harris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutch_Harris) of American [indie rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock) band [The Thermals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thermals) to teach the actors the musical parts that they would be performing onscreen.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-22) The film's soundtrack is largely populated by [heavy metal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metal_music) artists like Midnight rather than [white nationalist bands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_power_music). Saulnier says that he wanted the club to have more of a [Motörhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mot%C3%B6rhead)-like atmosphere, and that he had no intention of financially supporting white nationalist artists.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-23)

In addition to the songs appearing on the soundtrack, *Green Room* features several other punk and metal tracks, including [Fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_(band))'s "[Legalize Drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Have_Another_Beer_with_FEAR)" (1995), [Napalm Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napalm_Death)'s "[Suffer the Children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Corruption)" (1990), [Obituary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obituary_(band))'s "[Paralyzed with Fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inked_in_Blood)" (2014), [Poison Idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poison_Idea)'s "Taken By Surprise" (1990), [Slayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slayer)'s "[War Ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasons_in_the_Abyss)" (1990), and [Bad Brains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Brains)' "[Right Brigade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_for_Light)" (1982).[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-24)

The site's critical consensus reads: "*Green Room* delivers unapologetic genre thrills with uncommon intelligence and powerfully acted élan."[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-GreenRottenTomatoes-32) [Metacritic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic) gave it a weighted average score of 79 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "generally favorable" reviews.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-33)

[Richard Roeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Roeper) of the *[Chicago Sun-Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Sun-Times)* praised Patrick Stewart, Imogen Poots, Alia Shawkat and Macon Blair's performances and called the film "a wonderfully nasty, gruesome, jagged-edge gem of a horror film" that has "first-rate" cinematography, set design, soundtrack, and editing.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-34) Barry Hertz of *[The Globe and Mail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail)* awarded it a full four stars and wrote, "Jeremy Saulnier (Murder Party, Blue Ruin) continues one of the best streaks in independent horror with this terrifying and inventive thriller."[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-35) Lenika Cruz of *[The Atlantic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Atlantic)* said it's "a tense gore-fest, one that’s as grimy and claustrophobic as the titular room. But scrape off the scum, and you’ll find Green Room full of visual artistry, dark humor, smart writing, and glints of humanity".[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-36) *[IGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN)* awarded it a score of 9 out of 10, saying, "This follow-up to the brilliant *[Blue Ruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ruin)* pits a rock band against white supremacists with ace, ultra-violent results."[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-37)

Jeffrey Bloomer of *[Slate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slate_(magazine))* favorably compared the film's "genre maturity", "amoral survivalism and malleable sense of good and evil", "brutal efficiency" and "weary humor" to [John Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carpenter)'s *[Assault on Precinct 13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_on_Precinct_13_(1976_film))* and praised the cast, writing "If the world knows any justice[...] then the Screen Actors Guild will remember this cast when it doles out its awards next year".[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-38) [James Berardinelli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Berardinelli) concludes the film is "for anyone who enjoys sitting through 90 tense minutes and feeling the attendant adrenaline rush. It’s like a well-constructed horror movie" that's "As intimate as it is unnerving".[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-39) Guy Lodge of *[Variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_(magazine))* called it "a technically sharp backwoods horror-thriller that lacks a human element".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-VarietyReview-7) Leslie Felperin of *[The Hollywood Reporter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hollywood_Reporter)* wrote that it's entertaining but "less disciplined, less original and less memorable work than *[Blue Ruin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Ruin)*".[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Room_(film)/#cite_note-40)
