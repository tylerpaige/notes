Designers, as moderns, have a distinct problem with the passage of time—how to place themselves inside it, yet also outside it, but always against it. This dilemma plagued the teams at Wolff Olins and MCKL type foundry as they set out to define the touchstone for the Uber rebrand—the typeface.

Uber Move, Uber’s new custom typeface, was the result of a year-long collaboration between the team at Wolff Olins, led by Creative Director Forest Young, and MCKL, the type foundry of Jeremy Mickel. As Young would [explain](https://www.fastcompany.com/90235065/uber-has-a-new-brand-again), Uber had to outgrow the masculinity of cars—in fact, if it meant moving away from cars altogether, so much the better. Young put it this way,

>  The old Uber logo evoked the history of cars. You’re talking about adrenaline, letters that live on a grill. The letters are squareish and hyper masculine… But thinking beyond the car, to flying cars, a tuk tuk in Delhi, or a scooter in L.A., what’s an entity that’s broad enough to be colored by all these modalities that are yet to be defined, rather than constrained to the automotive space?

One might note that flying cars are still, well… cars. But that’s beside the point. What’s important is that Young and Mickel’s [process](https://www.fastcompany.com/90235065/uber-has-a-new-brand-again) doubled down on their intention to move away from anachronisms like cars:

>  To flesh out that font, dubbed Uber Move, the team began digging into historical typefaces of transportation, like the U.S.’s own Highway Gothic and the German traffic typeface DIN.

Young [bolstered](https://www.fastcompany.com/90235065/uber-has-a-new-brand-again) the move away from car transportation:

>  If we stayed true to the place of transportation, it would save us from going to the sea of things that are tech brands today, geometric sans, flat illustration, lifestyle imagery. All the par for the course. All these transportation typefaces are enduring because they have human factors at the heart of them.

A “traffic typeface.” Alright, maybe they could get away with a single car reference. But a font with the word “Highway” in the name as inspiration? “Staying true to the place of transportation?” What happened to moving away from cars?

![](https://elischiff.com/images/2018-10-10-roads@2x.webp)This is not a typeface that looks like a road. Your eyes are deceiving you. Uber has nothing to do with cars. Nothing! (MCKL Type, 2016).
Also, Uber didn’t get “saved” from using a geometric sans like most “tech brands today.” Uber Move is, in fact, a geometric sans. And it looks essentially the same as most of the latest custom-commissioned typefaces for major corporations, like Airbnb Cereal and Google Sans.

Type designer Erik Spiekermann was [blunt](https://twitter.com/espiekermann/status/1040174340573159424) about it, “A ‘fresh’ typeface? It may be new, but certainly not fresh… it’s boring & bland. But then every brand has the typeface it deserves… This is what trendy type looks like for now.”

![](https://elischiff.com/images/2018-10-10-guessing-game@2x.webp)Take a guess which set of fonts (A, B, or C) belongs to Uber Move, Airbnb Cereal, and Google Sans. Then ask your friends to take the quiz! (Don’t read this until you’ve played: evom rebu c snas elgoog b laerec bnbria a :srewsnA).
To be fair, Uber Move is not a terrible investment. It prominently made its way into Uber’s first major publication with the rebrand, their company values book: “77 Things.”
