It’s December, a time for reflection, even in the world of data visualisation. ’Tis the season of Charts of the Year. So let us delve a little deeper into the design thinking behind some of the year’s most popular FT graphics.

**The case for multiple charts**

Apple’s iPhone launches always attract attention. At least part of the annual cycle of fascination lies in comparing the impact of the latest device — the face-detecting iPhone X — with the sector-creating original. But how to explain that impact visually?

One option might be to simply plot Apple’s share price on a line chart and mark on the release date of each phone model. But this really misses the point: Apple’s share price has increased enormously during the past decade, making comparisons across individual product launches very difficult.

Instead, [for September’s launch](https://www.ft.com/content/44d8547a-97ed-11e7-a652-cde3f882dd7b) we decided to use a grid of charts, a chart layout technique known as “small multiples”, to view each release in its own six-day window (72 hours before, 72 hours after launch), and with Apple’s share price rebased to the day of launch itself.

A ghostly grey outline of the original release sits on the background of every launch allowing a direct comparison with each model. The final charts reveal that, with the possible exception of the iPhone 5 (Tim Cook’s first as CEO), Apple’s launches have not affected the company’s share price in the same way as the original.

The following month, my colleagues Steven Bernard and Chris Campbell used small multiple maps to show the progressive impact of rising coastlines on the US [Jersey Shore](https://www.ft.com/content/f95aa4e2-b3e6-11e7-aa26-bb002965bce8). In both of these examples, grid-like layouts allow for elegant presentation on both desktop and mobile devices simply by rearranging the grid.

**Making space for spatial**

Having written previously about [why we need to be careful in defaulting to maps](https://www.ft.com/content/de3ef722-9514-11e6-a1dc-bdf38d484582), it was lovely to see cartography take centre stage in a number of FT stories this year. For example, my colleague Liz Faunce’s [world map](https://www.ft.com/content/68113f82-ceda-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc) of housing wealth and natural hazards featured rich layers of information in a story replete with strong spatial patterns. It is a map for the reader to linger on.

Designing for different devices is something that has also occupied the FT graphics team this year. On smartphones, where space is at a premium, Liz’s map breaks into smaller pieces for easier reading, while on the desktop it expands to fill the screen.

**Creating a proper sense of scale**

At their most fundamental, charts allow us to see readily variations in the size of numbers. But what should you do when the things you want to compare are of very different magnitudes?

In November, Lauren Leatherby and John Authers [discovered the staggering fact](https://www.ft.com/content/d17a1da8-cf08-11e7-b781-794ce08b24dc) that just the increase in Amazon’s market capitalisation in 2017 alone was almost four times bigger than the total market capitalisation of 10 retailers that dominate US malls.

Bringing out the magnifying glass allows us to see the relative size of each of the mall companies and still keep the radically different proportions in context.

**Avoiding chart spaghetti**

How many lines of data can you put on a chart before it loses the ability to enlighten? Four, perhaps five? [FT analysis](https://www.ft.com/content/e0ae58a6-cf95-11e7-9dbb-291a884dd8c6) of the UK budget in November included a chart of all 16 “fiscal events” referred to in Philip Hammond’s speech as well as pre- and post- crisis averages.

The secret to preventing reader incomprehension is to use grey effectively, providing a foreground/background contrast. The fiscal events remain discrete but subdued, unlabelled save for the first and last.

**The spirit of Playfair**

You could argue that the first modern data graphics — the beautiful, hand-drawn charts of William Playfair — benefited from not being created on a computer.

Created in the 18th century, his charts eschewed legends with Playfair preferring to annotate the lines on his charts directly. This makes sense because the reader does not need to look away from the data to read the chart. But the angled nature of Playfair’s data labels, following every rise and fall of the data they describe, is a technique that has fallen largely out of favour for a good reason: text oriented along a line is generally harder to read.

   ![William Playfair's hand-drawn chart of imports and exports, 1786](https://www.ft.com/__origami/service/image/v2/images/raw/http%3A%2F%2Fcom.ft.imagepublish.upp-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4f6382d0-e4d1-11e7-97e2-916d4fbac0da?fit=scale-down&source=next&width=700)A source of inspiration: William Playfair's hand-drawn chart of imports and exports, 1786
In certain cases, though, where we want to emphasise the direction and rate of change, text rendered on a line can be a nice touch. John Burn-Murdoch used the technique to great effect in Sarah O’Connor’s powerful look at [Blackpool and the towns the economy forgot](https://www.ft.com/content/b6dbf34e-c987-11e7-aa33-c63fdc9b8c6c).

**Mind the gap**

Another Playfair-influenced tip; on some charts it’s the relationship between two things that is of most interest.

In this year’s UK election manifestos, Labour and the Conservatives proposed very different policies for [managing the budget deficit](https://www.ft.com/content/5d94202c-55c9-11e7-80b6-9bfa4c1f83d2). By shading the gaps between expenditure and income, we can see historical surpluses and deficits. Adapting colour and transparency allows us to overlay continuations based on the two parties’ proposals — a bigger deficit under Labour, based on higher spending and taxation, a smaller deficit based on continuing austerity from the Conservatives. That is three series (income/expenditure/balance) with actual data and two scenarios in an easy-to-digest format.

A similar approach was used to create the focal point for looking at how the UK has gone from top to bottom of the G7 growth rankings in Chris Giles’s recent look at the [real cost of Brexit](https://www.ft.com/content/e3b29230-db5f-11e7-a039-c64b1c09b482).

**Surprise!**

Finally, although consistency is an admirable quality, do not be afraid to break the mould when it comes to designing graphics, especially when you want to surprise your audience.

How many FT readers were expecting to see more than 60 adorable panda faces filed under China Politics and Policy? Jane Pong’s [visual history](https://www.ft.com/content/eef55968-bebb-11e7-b8a3-38a6e068f464) of Beijing’s “furry ambassadors” charmed readers in a memorable way. But I am pleased Jane spared readers the distress from extending that playful iconography to represent the expired pandas; little red dots are perhaps a more humane way to mark their passing.
