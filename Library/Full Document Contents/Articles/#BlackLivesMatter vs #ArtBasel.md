MIAMI BEACH — I spent hours today inside the Miami Beach Convention Center, taking in the thousands of artworks at this year’s [Art Basel Miami Beach](https://www.artbasel.com/miami-beach) fair and gawking at the colorfully dressed collectors as they casually committed to spending hundreds of thousands of dollars. Cell phone service was spotty at best, but when I emerged in the late afternoon, I opened Twitter to discover that, only a week after the grand jury in St. Louis failed to indict police officer Darren Wilson for the killing of Mike Brown, the grand jury in Staten Island has [failed to indict](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/04/nyregion/grand-jury-said-to-bring-no-charges-in-staten-island-chokehold-death-of-eric-garner.html?_r=0) police officer Daniel Pantaleo for the [killing of Eric Garner](http://hyperallergic.com/139259/spike-lee-draws-out-the-parallels-between-art-and-life-and-death/).

Protests have now erupted in New York City and throughout the country in response to the decision. And, unsurprisingly, the best expression of the cognitive dissonance I’m once again feeling — living simultaneously in the real world and the art world, which feel so frustratingly far apart — comes in the form of a tweet from artist [Beth Whitney](http://www.bethwhitney.com/):

To put those images directly back to back, that’s protesters staging a lie-in at American University in Washington, DC:
