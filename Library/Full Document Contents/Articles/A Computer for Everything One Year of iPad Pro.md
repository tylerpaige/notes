After [years](https://www.macstories.net/stories/comparing-my-favorite-ios-text-editors/) spent adapting what I learned from the Mac to bring it to iOS, what [I found on the other side](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-air-2-review-why-the-ipad-became-my-main-computer/) was a more focused, efficient way of working and communicating with people. The iPad Pro accelerated my move to an iOS-only setup; today, I genuinely don’t know how to perform certain tasks on a Mac anymore.

I [use my iPad Pro](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/) for everything. It’s my writing machine and favorite research tool, but I also rely on it to organize my finances, play games, read books and watch movies, program in Python and Workflow, and manage two [successful](https://www.macstories.net/) [businesses](https://club.macstories.net/?utm_source=ms&utm_medium=iPadProYear). While I’ve been [advocating](https://www.macstories.net/stories/working-on-the-ipad-one-year-later-still-my-favorite-computer/) for such multi-purpose use of the iPad platform for a [while](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-mini-for-content-creation/), the iPad Pro elevated the threshold of possibilities, reaching an inflection point that has pushed others to switch to an iPad as their primary computer as well.

Much of the iPad’s strength lies in iOS and its app ecosystem. If Apple were to stop making iPads, I’d still prefer to work on a device that runs iOS rather than macOS. iOS is where app innovation happens on a regular basis with developers one-upping each other in terms of what software can achieve; I also prefer the structure and interactions of iOS itself. The iPad Pro is the purest representation of iOS: it’s a computer that can transform into anything you need it to be.

Even if this discussion was settled a long time ago, it bears repeating: millions of people today like working on iOS more than they do on macOS, and the iPad Pro is the best machine to run iOS. There is no sarcastic subtext about the Mac here, which is still a fantastic environment that many Apple users love and need for their line of work. The Mac and the iPad can coexist in a market where customers believe one is superior to the other. I prefer working on the iPad; others like their Macs more. And that’s fine because, ultimately, the Apple ecosystem as a whole grows stronger and we all reap the benefits.

Over the past year of daily iPad Pro usage, I’ve made it my personal goal to optimize my iPad workflows as much as possible. This is one of the best aspects of the iOS platform: competition between developers is fierce and you can always choose between different apps to get work done – apps that are improved on a regular basis and are constantly updated for the latest iOS technologies. With enough curiosity and patience, iOS rewards you with the discovery of new ways to work and save time.

Since [my last iPad story in February](https://www.macstories.net/stories/working-on-the-ipad-one-year-later-still-my-favorite-computer/), I’ve taken a hard look at my entire iPad setup and rethought the parts that weren’t working. I tried new apps, created new automations, and optimized every weak spot I could find. I improved how I collaborate with my teammates and produce weekly content for [Club MacStories](https://club.macstories.net/?utm_source=ms&utm_medium=iPadProYear) members. Thanks to the time I invested in understanding and fine-tuning my iPad Pro, I was able to embark on more projects, double MacStories’ growth, and manage a larger team.

As a result, my iPad Pro today is noticeably more capable than it was a year ago – all without the need for a hardware refresh.

Here’s what I’ve done.
