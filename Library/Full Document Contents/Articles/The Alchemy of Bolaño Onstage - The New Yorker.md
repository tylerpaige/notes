“How can someone ever truly know the work of another?” So says the irrepressible publisher Mrs. Bubis (played by the irrepressible Janet Ulrich Brooks) to Jean-Claude Pelletier (Lawrence Grimm) and Manuel Espinoza (Demetrios Troy), two academics she is entertaining smartly in her Hamburg home. The French Pelletier and the Spanish Espinoza, one tall, the other dark, have travelled from their respective countries to meet the great woman. Actually, the flirtatious Mrs. Bubis may not be that great, but she has an aura of greatness, if only by association: she’s responsible for putting out the work of the elusive postwar German writer Benno von Archimboldi, as was her late husband. Pelletier and Espinoza became obsessed with Archimboldi as students, and it’s exciting and frustrating for them to hear about him from his former associate: Archimboldi left so little biographical information behind. Still, his life as an artist is on full display in his fiction, which inspires any number of fantasies in the minds of his readers, including these feverish academics, who treat Mrs. Bubis’s sitting room as a kind of shrine.

This amusing, slightly unholy trinity is the invention of the late Chilean writer Roberto Bolaño, in his long, alternately phantasmagoric and reportorial novel “2666,” adapted, with incredible care and a certain amount of pride, by Robert Falls and Seth Bockley, who also co-directed the show (at the Goodman, in Chicago). In the novel, Bolaño asks the same question as Mrs. Bubis, but with a twist: How much can we know about any life, beyond its metaphors—its myths, its storytelling, its lies?

Bolaño was born in Santiago in 1953, the son of a schoolteacher and a truck driver and occasional boxer. Beside his more robust father, Bolaño was awkward, thin, and bookish, in a culture that valorized machismo. As a teen-ager, he moved to Mexico, where he dropped out of school and eventually found work as a journalist. In 1973, inspired by socialist change at home, he went back to Chile, only to be arrested, along with other intellectuals, after Pinochet’s right-wing coup. (Rescue came in the shape of two former classmates, now prison guards, who orchestrated his release.) In the late seventies, Bolaño settled in Spain, where he supported himself as, variously, a bellhop and a garbage collector. Often writing at night, he produced some two dozen books of fiction and poetry before his death, from liver failure, in 2003. “2666” was published the following year. One wonders less what he would have made of the present adaptation of his nearly nine-hundred-page novel than how he might have incorporated the process of adapting “2666” into his own work: a dominant theme in Bolaño’s fiction is alchemy—how some thing or person can metamorphose into a completely different element or being.

“2666” is divided into five “books.” The first, “The Part About the Critics” (which Falls and Bockley retitled “The Part About the Academics”), strikes me as the strongest, in its ability to balance the fantastic with absurd realism—the absurd part being how love rubs up against our attraction to, and need to challenge, power. Falls and Bockley open the play at a conference somewhere in Europe; Pelletier and Espinoza, dressed in the drab, ill-fitting clothing of underpaid tenure-track scholars, are arranging several tables into a dais. Each describes how the other first came across Archimboldi’s work, as more scholars of the German master’s œuvre are introduced, including the beautiful British academic Liz Norton (Nicole Wiesner) and the Italian Piero Morini (Sean Fortunato). The colleagues become friends, and friendly rivals, united by their admiration for a writer whose own work is rarely quoted. The absence of Archimboldi’s texts only makes him loom larger in the audience’s imagination, just as the fact that none of the academics share a language—and all had to learn Archimboldi’s in order to read him—hovers over the proceedings, reminding us that the drama being enacted is partly about language itself.

To all that, “2666” adds the confusion of love and desire. Pelletier and Norton hook up, and then she turns, in a fit of pique, to Espinoza. Norton isn’t seeking only sex or attention; she wants to extract some kind of revenge for the way her work is sometimes trivialized in the academic world because she’s a woman. When Espinoza and Pelletier fight over her, she points out that it’s their male urge to compete and possess that fucks them up. She says, “All because of some patriarchal obsession over how many lovers I have at any given time? Who cares?” Still, Pelletier can’t help identifying with his gender. At one point, somewhat ruefully and tenderly, he describes Espinoza’s feelings for Norton, which he sees as a mirror to his own:

> First, the need to be near Liz Norton struck sometime before he got back to his apartment in Madrid. By the time he was on the plane he’d realized that she was the perfect woman, the one he’d always hoped to find, and he began to suffer. Second, among the ideal images of Norton that passed through his head as the plane flew towards Spain, there were more sex scenes than I had imagined.

In Bolaño’s world, what is imagined is equal to what is enacted; reality is provisional. Although Falls and Bockley do a fine job of making that clear, it’s not an inherently dramatic point of view: naturalistic plays like this always argue, ultimately, for realism. And, as the five-and-a-half-hour piece goes on, accumulating fantasies, characters, and scenes of violence—Part IV, “The Part About the Crimes,” for instance, describes a series of killings of women in Mexico and how the murders went unsolved for years, probably because the victims were female—it becomes more traditional, too, despite the many storytelling styles that Falls and Bockley employ. (Some sections are narrated in the first person, some in the third, and there are a number of devices, including video and sound, which—with one boringly dodgy exception, when a stereotypical angry black male voice plays over the loudspeaker—don’t seem slick or trendy, because, as a whole, the piece is guileless.) I don’t know if the collaborators felt constricted by the Bolaño estate or by the text, but the entire script would have opened up if they’d forgone the American penchant for the linear narrative and used Bolaño’s fantastical elements as a jumping-off point from which to dream their own version of “2666.”

Instead, we get an overload of plot, and, by the end of the spectacle, the story feels resolved, wrapped up, depthless. That’s when we meet Hans Reiter (Mark L. Montgomery). A hapless former German soldier, Hans became Archimboldi the way anyone becomes an artist: through the accidents of history and culture. Watching the final act, I thought back to Part I, the part in which the play’s themes are most successfully demonstrated. The academics are defined by conflicts that are dramatic, without being dramatic themselves. They’re smart but emotional lunkheads, too aware that the world doesn’t prize their brand of thinking. They defend themselves and their marginalization by being smug to “lesser” outsiders when they can. On a visit to London, Pelletier and Espinoza cuddle with Norton in the back seat of a taxi, while the taxi-driver (Adam Poss) looks on. When Norton suggests that he’s lost, the driver says, “The labyrinth of London disorients me.” Noting that he’s quoting Jorge Luis Borges, Norton, ever the persnickety academic, challenges him; she wants to top him with her knowledge, or be topped by his presumed lack of cultivation. Others, before Borges, observed the same thing, she says, Dickens, for one, and Robert Louis Stevenson. The driver, who knows this is a putdown, puts Norton down in the only way a man can—by turning her sexuality into a negative, saying, “In my country, there is a word for what she is.”

Pelletier and Espinoza are soon beating the man nearly to death, their prejudices punctuating their punches. “Shove Islam up your ass,” Espinoza shouts. “This one is for Salman Rushdie!” Literature as an occasion for hate, a hate crime as an occasion for the academic to exercise his power as a “real” man: like the best of Falls and Bockley’s “2666,” this scene shows, rather than tells, what Bolaño, that gawky, sensitive son of machismo’s brutalities and bigotry, saw everywhere—force winning out over dialogue, no matter how carefully rendered. ♦
