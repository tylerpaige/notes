If you’re a regular reader of the Times Open blog, you hopefully know that we are [proud of the engineering culture](https://open.nytimes.com/diversity-inclusion-and-culture-steps-for-building-great-teams-ca157bd98c07) at The Times. As a VP of engineering and someone who has been with The Times for 11 years, that culture is why I’m here. I love being surrounded by a diverse, multi-talented, collaborative, mission-driven group of engineers, designers, data analysts and others who contribute to the making of our products.

Over the last few months, we have been tackling probably the biggest determinant of our culture: our hiring process. Our old process had problems we needed to address. With many similar jobs posted at any given time, candidates would often apply to multiple jobs and be confused about which they were considered for — or worse, they were asked to interview multiple times for multiple teams. Since our teams had different criteria for hiring engineers, they also didn’t trust each other and would sometimes give technical interviews when engineers wanted to transfer teams internally.

Over the years, we’ve lost several external and internal candidates who wanted to be at The Times but were frustrated by having to prove themselves again and again.

We recently made a major change: rather than having separate job postings and interview processes for each team, we consolidated to a single application and review process across all our front-end openings.

By having a single application process, we hope to help candidates match to the teams that best fit their career goals early in their application. This will also make it easier for candidates to change teams and grow their careers once they’ve been hired. Having a single application process also ensures that we are being consistent and fair about how we evaluate candidates however they come to us.

This was not an easy or comfortable change. Individual teams feared they would lose the ability to find candidates that fit their particular needs. We also had concerns that the process would become too impersonal and candidates would not be able to get to know the team they would join. We ultimately concluded that this process reflects the type of organization we want to be: one with an expansive definition of team where we take broad responsibility for the career development of engineers we hire.

As a front-end engineer at The New York Times, you will work on a specific engineering team tackling a problem, but also join a larger community of engineers across the organization.

I’m sharing our process here in the hope it will help others thinking about their own hiring process, and as a guide for what to expect if you’re interested in applying to The Times. (And please do [apply](https://nytimes.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Tech/job/New-York-NY/Frontend-Engineer--Various-Teams_REQ-003548-1)!).

### The Process

If you are interested in a front-end engineering role at The New York Times, the first step in the process is [to apply](https://nytimes.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Tech/job/New-York-NY/Frontend-Engineer--Various-Teams_REQ-003548-1)**.** As you’ll notice, the application explains what the role will entail, the qualities that help engineers thrive at The Times and it lists the teams that currently have open positions.

Each week our Talent and Inclusion partners and a panel of engineering managers review resumes and decide who to move forward in the process. Depending on the number of applications at any given time, you should get a response within one to two weeks.

If the hiring panel thinks your resume matches what we’re looking for, you’ll be scheduled for a phone call with someone on our Talent and Inclusion team. That call will focus on the kind of work you’ve done to date and what you’re looking for in a role at The Times. The goal is to begin to match you with a team and to make sure we have something that fits your career goals. Ideally, this will happen within a week of you submitting your resume.

Next you will have a phone call or Google Hangout with a hiring manager or a senior engineer on one of the teams you are being considered for. This call will be an opportunity for us to evaluate your technical skills and how you work. It’s also an opportunity for you to find out more about the different openings and what it’s like to work as a front-end engineer at The Times.

If there’s mutual interest after both conversations, we’ll then send you a short coding exercise that you can complete on your own time. We understand that people have busy lives, so there is no time limit. The project won’t require you to dig up any old computer science textbooks or learn a new programming language, and we’ve heard from previous candidates that it’s even fun! It’s meant as an opportunity for you to show us how you would think through a project along the lines of something you might do at The Times.

If you pass the coding exercise, then the final step is a set of in-person (or remote) interviews. During these sessions you will meet with engineers and non-technical members of at least two teams that are the best fits based on your previous conversations. Each interview should be between 30–45 minutes with two other people at a time. We have you meet people in pairs to minimize the bias of a single interviewer, but not to overwhelm you.

The entire interview day should take roughly four to five hours. Yes, that’s a lot, but we’ve found that candidates appreciate meeting a number of their future team members and having the opportunity ask questions. We also think it’s important that multiple members of the team, not just engineers, are involved in hiring.

We are now six weeks into this new process and have candidates at every stage, from resume review to in-person interview. We are evaluating the process as we go and, like in [everything we do](https://open.nytimes.com/develop-your-culture-like-software-a1a3c1acfd6e), have already made changes to how we score and evaluate resumes.

We are accepting applications now, so [please apply](https://nytimes.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/en-US/Tech/job/New-York-NY/Frontend-Engineer--Various-Teams_REQ-003548-1). We look forward to hearing from you.
