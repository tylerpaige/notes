In the past decade, the font has played a role in several forgery allegations. Its designer responds.

Lucas de Groot, a Dutch typeface designer living in Berlin, recently began receiving a flood of calls and e-mails from Pakistan that, he said, “seemed very urgent.” He soon discovered that Calibri, a font he’d designed almost fifteen years earlier, was playing a central role in a corruption scandal engulfing Nawaz Sharif, the Prime Minister of Pakistan. As part of an investigation launched by the country’s Supreme Court, the Prime Minister’s daughter had released a supposedly exculpatory document signed and dated February 2, 2006. The document, however, had been printed in Calibri, which was not widely available until 2007. Investigators deemed the document to have been falsified, and the term “fontgate” began trending on Twitter.

Speaking from his office in Berlin, de Groot said that the incident “has definitely generated the most publicity for Calibri, ever.” He admitted to being a little bit happy about it. “People usually take fonts for granted,” he said.

Calibri was born in 2004, when a fellow typeface designer recruited de Groot to work on a project for “a secret client.” The client wanted a modern font that was optimized for screen reading. De Groot revised a font he’d developed seven years earlier, paying special attention to “the rhythm of the letter widths” and “the speed of the curvature.” The client turned out to be Microsoft, which, to de Groot’s astonishment, chose Calibri as the default font for its Microsoft Office suite. His payment for the font covered some office renovations, but not much else. “I am not a very good businessman,” he said.

Since 2007, Calibri has figured in several other forgery allegations. In 2012, the Turkish government accused approximately three hundred people of plotting a coup, on the basis of documents that had been printed in Calibri but were purported to date from as early as 2003. De Groot sent a form letter in response to the many inquiries he received from Pakistan. “In my opinion, the document in question was produced much later” than 2006, he wrote. While Microsoft had by then released a beta version of its Office suite that included Calibri, de Groot pointed out that only “computer nerds” and “font lovers” were using it. “Why would anyone use a completely unknown font for an official document?”

By coincidence, the font also figures in America’s ongoing Presidential scandal. One day before fontgate, Donald Trump, Jr., took to Twitter to release the e-mails he wrote while setting up a meeting between members of the Trump campaign and Russians offering dirt on Hillary Clinton. He included a short introductory note—“in order to be totally transparent, I am releasing the entire email chain of my emails”—typed in Calibri.

While most Trump critics focussed on the contents of the e-mail chain, a few zeroed in on Donald, Jr.,’s font choice. A writer for *Elle*’*s* Web site called Calibri “fine for a grocery list; a less ideal choice for what’s supposed to be a considered response.” One Twitter user said, “The part that angers me most is his use of Calibri font, which I hate #sad #loweffort.”

De Groot is “not a big fan” of the Trump Administration, but he defended Donald, Jr.,’s choice of Calibri, explaining that the President’s son may have been trying to tap into the font’s relatability. “Calibri is a font that everybody recognizes—a normal font,” he said. “Everybody who reads his note will realize, ‘Hey, this is the font that I’m using.’ It comes off genuine.”

De Groot dismissed the critics who attack Calibri as boring, arguing that its “neutrality” belies its underlying precision: “If you’re eating soup, you shouldn’t remember the shape of the spoon.” He listed Calibri’s virtues: it doesn’t try to mimic what already exists (“Courier is an ugly old typewriter font”); it’s stripped of old-fashioned serif embellishments (“Compared to Calibri, Times New Roman looks outdated”); and it’s playful, with its rounded corners, but not frivolous (“Comic Sans doesn’t work”).

A Pakistani journalist recently tweeted that if Prime Minister Sharif is forced out of office he should write his resignation letter using Calibri. If the Russia investigation forces Trump to resign, should the U.S. President do the same? De Groot considered. “I don’t think Calibri fits with the voice of Donald Trump, not at all,” he said. “He’s speaking so poorly, a very bold kind of speech. A resignation letter by Trump should be in black capitals—loud. You need Franklin Gothic extra bold, I think.” ♦
