### How can a coder help The New York Times newsroom?

The Interactive News desk at The New York Times is looking to connect with creative, interdisciplinary thinkers with strong technical backgrounds. Our desk is the special digital projects team embedded within the newsroom of The New York Times.

#### About Us

* We’re a small team passionate about improving newsgathering through technology.
* We work with editors, reporters, photographers, designers and other developers to build newsroom-facing tools and reader-facing projects that expand the horizons of our digital news report. We guide, train and support the newsroom’s use of our software.
* We don't make data visualizations or create custom experiences like Snowfall. We don't write stories. Sometimes we help with these, but they are not the core focus of our team.
* Sometimes we will craft bots. Other times we publish open-source libraries. Often, we deploy custom software that helps make The Times’s reporting and storytelling better.
* We use technology to solve big problems at newsroom scale. We are our own product managers, and our own systems on-call. We own everything from concept to the final user experience.
* Our projects range in scope from small prototypes to large applications. You can see several examples of our work here:
