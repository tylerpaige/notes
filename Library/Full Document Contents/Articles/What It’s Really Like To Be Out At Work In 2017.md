By the time I interviewed for my first professional internship, I was already out to my family and friends. But figuring out how to be out at work still wasn’t something I was prepared for.

During the interview, for a small lefty book publisher in New York, I ended up blurting out something about how being gay made me feel committed to social justice. It was true, but it felt like a cheap way to win points, and I regretted it even after getting the internship. Later that summer, riding the elevator up with an editor one Monday morning, I blushed red while describing the barbecue I’d gone to over the weekend “at one of my boyfriend’s friends’.”

I was hugely privileged to be a college-educated, young, white gay man getting my foot in the door with a liberal employer in a liberal industry in a liberal city. But even so, determining whom to come out to and how to do it was often a fraught, awkward, frustrating experience.

These are uncomfortable calculations that many queer people face at work–and for some, they’re perilous ones. The Justice Department [rolled back protections for LGBTQ workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/nyregion/justice-department-gays-workplace.html) in July, and it remains [legal to fire someone for being gay or transgender in 28 states](https://www.fastcompany.com/40456937/heres-everywhere-in-the-u-s-you-can-still-get-fired-for-being-gay-or-trans). But others in the community have radically different workplace experiences, including the cover subject of *Fast Company’*s “Out at Work” package, screenwriter and actor Lena Waithe.
