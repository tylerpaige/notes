One summer holiday on the island of Sicily, home to Mount Etna, Andrea Trimarchi and Simone Farresin became obsessed with basalt, the volcanic rock created as lava cools. Trimarchi was born there and is well acquainted with the unpredictable power of Etna. “It’s like a mine without miners,” he says. “It’s always throwing out materials.”

The same could be said of the objects and furniture designed by Trimarchi and Farresin, who work under the name [Studio Formafantasma](http://www.formafantasma.com/filter/home). Based in Amsterdam, the two founded the firm in 2009, opting against using their own names because “we wanted to be a different entity than what we are as individuals,” says Farresin, 36. The name means “ghost shape,” which is indicative of their process — one that emphasizes the amorphous early stages of creation, when the mind is “cloudy and full of potential,” says Trimarchi, 33.

While many designers today speak of research-based practices, for Formafantasma it is the essence of their work, responsible for some of the most interesting and conceptually rich pieces being made today. The duo manages to transform unlikely, sometimes esoteric inspirations into tangible art. But while their burgeoning reputation is for imbuing everyday objects with social or political significance, it is never in a dull or pedantic way. The intricate, detailed stories behind their designs only amplify the objects’ beauty and power, like the elegant mohair blankets that include architectural drawings and written data relating to Italy’s reckless colonial past.

Their collections are generally one-off collaborations sparked by a topic and done with galleries, brands or foundations. For [Plart](http://www.plartdesign.it/en/), the Italian foundation dedicated to the conservation of work in plastic, the two spent months investigating the 18th- and 19th-century scientists who experimented with preindustrial polymers (like *bois durci*, a pliable substance composed of wood dust and animal blood). The six vases and two bowls that resulted, with organic details embedded in the resin and colors reflecting the natural world, look as if they were pulled from the earth.
