Summary: Michel Foucault explores how different cultures create and change ways of ordering knowledge over time. He shows that from the sixteenth century, Western thought shifted its view of order and knowledge deeply. This shift led to the rise of human sciences, where humans themselves became a subject of study.

## Highlights
- the exotic charm of another system of thought, is the limitation of our own, the stark impossibility of thinking *that*. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf6j7251d0vsmjkp4v8q2wv6))
- The monstrous quality that runs through Borges’s enumeration consists, on the contrary, in the fact that the common ground on which such meetings are possible has itself been destroyed. What is impossible is not the propinquity of the things listed, but the very site on which their propinquity would be possible. The animals “(i) frenzied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very ﬁne camelhair brush” — where could they ever meet, except in the immaterial sound of the voice pronouncing their enumeration, or on the page transcribing it? Where else could they be juxtaposed except in the non-place of language? Yet, though language can spread them before us, it can do so only in an unthinkable space.

- Perhaps because there arose in its wake the suspicion that there is a worse kind of disorder than that of the *incongruous*, the linking together of things that are inappropriate; I mean the disorder in which fragments of a large number of possible orders glitter separately in the dimension, without law or geometry, of the *heteroclite*; and that word should be taken in its most literal, etymological sense: in such a state, things are “laid”, “placed”, “arranged” in sites so very different from one another that it is impossible to ﬁnd a place of residence for them, to deﬁne a common locus beneath them all.

    - Note: i want to find this illuminating, but unfortunately i dont understand. it seems like the second object (the thing “worse” than the incongruous) is just a more verbose description of the incongruous. what is the difference between these two things? why is one worse? 
      incongruous is when you link things that are inappropriate… does he mean the linking is inappropriate or that the things themselves are inappropriate?
      the heyeroclite is when things are placed in locations for which no common parent location exists… there is no common ancestor between them. they are intractably separate
- This is why Utopias permit fables and discourse: they run with the very grain of language and are part of the fundamental dimension of the *fabula*; heterotopias (such as those to be found so often in Borges) desiccate speech, stop words in their tracks, contest the very possibility of grammar at its source; they dissolve our myths and sterilize the lyricism of our sentences.

- A “system of elements” — a deﬁnition of the segments by which the resemblances and differences can be shown, the types of variation by which those segments can be affected, and, lastly, the threshold above which there is a difference and below which there is a similitude — is indispensable for the establishment of even the simplest form of order. Order is, at one and the same time, that which is given in things as their inner law, the hidden network that determines the way they confront one another, and also that which has no existence except in the grid created by a glance, an examination, a language; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf6kzgyt7bpa1f3m6n3xaf79))
- But between these two regions, so distant from one another, lies a domain which, even though its role is mainly an intermediary one, is nonetheless fundamental: it is more confused, more obscure, and probably less easy to analyse. It is here that a culture, imperceptibly deviating from the empirical orders prescribed for it by its primary codes, instituting an initial separation from them, causes them to lose their original transparency, relinquishes its immediate and invisible powers, frees itself sufﬁciently to discover that these orders are perhaps not the only possible ones or the best ones; this culture then ﬁnds itself faced with the stark fact that there exists, below the level of its spontaneous orders, things that are in themselves capable of being ordered, that belong to a certain unspoken order; the fact, in short, that order *exists*.

    - Note: AI summary:
      > Invisible powers of culture: Culture has invisible powers that shape how people think, behave, and connect by passing on values, meanings, and norms without people always noticing. These powers can be weakened or lost through forces like migration, globalization, discrimination, or deliberate suppression, which break links between generations and reduce shared practices. Losing these invisible powers can make communities feel less rooted, weaken social support, and erase ways of knowing that have guided everyday life.
      this phrasing makes a lot more sense to me!
- As though emancipating itself to some extent from its linguistic, perceptual, and practical grids, the culture superimposed on them another kind of grid which neutralized them, which by this superimposition both revealed and excluded them at the same time, so that the culture, by this very process, came face to face with order in its primary state.

    - Note: AI summary:
      > Cognitive grids and cultural neutralization: Cultures sometimes impose a neutralizing grid on perception and practice, meaning shared rules and categories that simplify or hide differences so people see things in a uniform way. This process shapes behavior, language, and institutions by making certain actions seem normal and others invisible or irrelevant. Over time, the grid can reduce conflict and variation but also limit creativity and erase minority perspectives.
      honestly i dint see how Foucault”s sentence has that meaning…
- It is on the basis of this newly perceived order that the codes of language, perception, and practice are criticized and rendered partially invalid. It is on the basis of this order, taken as a ﬁrm foundation, that general theories as to the ordering of things, and the interpretation that such an ordering involves, will be constructed. Thus ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf6n0h8rgawv7z8jsfdksk12))
    - Note: Q: Explain this. Are these two sentences not opposite declarations?
      A: They are not strict opposites but complementary claims about "order": one says order is immanent in things (an inner law), the other that order is produced by a cultural/language "grid"—Foucault's point is the paradoxical double status of order as both discovered in things and constructed by systems of thought, not a contradiction but a dialectic showing how orders are both perceived and historically constituted.
- between the already “encoded” eye and reﬂexive knowledge there is a middle region which liberates order itself: it is here that it appears, according to the culture and the age in question, continuous and graduated or discontinuous and piecemeal, linked to space or constituted anew at each instant by the driving force of time, related to a series of variables or deﬁned by separate systems of coherences, composed of resemblances which are either successive or corresponding, organized around increasing differences, etc. This middle region, then, in so far as it makes manifest the modes of being of order, can be posited as the most fundamental of all: anterior to words, perceptions, and gestures, which are then taken to be more or less exact, more or less happy, expressions of it (which is why this experience of order in its pure primary state always plays a critical role); more solid, more archaic, less dubious, always more “true” than the theories that attempt to give those expressions explicit form, exhaustive application, or philosophical foundation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf6n61g6qptgx50aqav0vv0r))
    - Note: Q: When Foucault names this “middle region,” what two points is it in between? Is it (A) recognition that an order is implicit thereby allowing us to develop understanding and (B) recognition that culture imposes this order and thereby limits other possible understandings? Or is it some other dialectic?
      Similarly, what is Foucault saying this middle region offers? What does it mean to “liberate order”? 
      A: Foucault locates the middle region between (1) the everyday, “encoded” practices and perceptual/language codes that make order transparent and operative, and (2) reflexive scientific or philosophical theories that explicitly explain and justify order; it is not simply A vs. B but an intermediary between tacit (implicit) ordering and explicit theorization. The middle region “liberates order” by making the modes or forms of ordering themselves visible — momentarily detaching culture’s habitual grids so that order appears in its primary modalities (how things can be grouped, spaced, timed), enabling critique of existing codes and the formulation of new epistemic possibilities.
      AI summary:
      > The experience of order in its pure primary state refers to a basic, immediate sense that things are arranged or fit together without needing analysis or explanation. It is often described as a direct, pre-reflective feeling that elements in perception or thought are harmonious, simple, and coherent. This concept appears in psychology and philosophy when discussing how humans recognize patterns, meaning, or structure before applying learned categories or higher reasoning.
- Thus, in every culture, between the use of what one might call the ordering codes and reﬂections upon order itself, there is the pure experience of order and of its modes of being. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf6npx1mz4vjhxpzck4jyzhc))
- Now, this archaeological inquiry has revealed two great discontinuities in the *episteme* of Western culture: the ﬁrst inaugurates the Classical age (roughly half-way through the seventeenth century) and the second, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, marks the beginning of the modem age. The order on the basis of which we think today does not have the same mode of being as that of the Classical thinkers. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf6p30cfxne74282bebcct9d))
- In this way, analysis has been able to show the coherence that existed, throughout the Classical age, between the theory of representation and the theories of language, of the natural orders, and of wealth and value. It is this conﬁguration that, from the nineteenth century onward, changes entirely; the theory of representation disappears as the universal foundation of all possible orders; language as the spontaneous *tabula*, the primary grid of things, as an indispensable link between representation and things, is eclipsed in its turn; a profound historicity penetrates into the heart of things, isolates and deﬁnes them in their own coherence, imposes upon them the forms of order implied by the continuity of time; the analysis of exchange and money gives way to the study of production, that of the organism takes precedence over the search for taxonomic characteristics, and, above all, language loses its privileged position and becomes, in its turn, a historical form coherent with the density of its own past. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf6p9mnya6pavhcxtwcm4vyr))
    - Note: Q: What is the Classical age’s “theory of representation?” What are its “theories of language, natural orders, wealth, and value?” Describe how the Classical age’s made a coherence between them.
      A: In the Classical episteme representation is the idea that words and signs map a pre-existing, tabulated order of things—language functions as a neutral “table” that directly indexes and makes visible distinctions among entities; natural orders are conceived as fixed taxonomies determined by observable similarities and differences; wealth and value are understood through analyses of exchange and circulation (money as measure and mediator) rather than production; these domains are cohered because the same mode of ordering—spatial, classificatory grids instantiated by language—serves as the universal foundation linking naming, classification, and economic calculation so that grammar, natural history, and political economy all rest on a common representational logic.
      Q: Describe how the 19th century broke the Classical age’s coherence. What is distinct about the latter episteme from the former?
      A: Foucault argues the 19th century dismantled the Classical episteme by overthrowing representation and the primacy of language as the universal grid: things ceased to be ordered by static classificatory tables and instead gained historicity, internal development, and reflexivity. The modern episteme privileges time, development, production, and organism (historical forms and processes) over the Classical focus on fixed taxonomies, representation, and exchange, and it finally places "man" as an object constituted within those historical processes.
      Q: Elaborate on this, and provide some examples.
      A: In the Classical episteme things are ordered spatially by a representational “table” (language, names, and taxonomies that fix identity and relations—e.g. Linnaean species, grammatical categories, or mercantile accounts of value), whereas the modern episteme reads things temporally as processes with internal histories (organisms, production processes, evolution, social formation) so knowledge explains entities by development and functions rather than by their place in a static grid.
      Examples:
      1. Classical natural history: Linnaeus sorts organisms by visible traits into fixed genera/species (a classificatory table); Modern biology/Cuvier–Darwin: organisms are understood through anatomy, function, lineage and evolution (historicity, organism, internal development).
      2. Classical language/grammar: Port‑Royal-style universal grammar treats words as mirroring a fixed logical order (representation as primary); Modern linguistics/historical philology: language is a historical form with change, mutations, and internal rules shaped over time.
      3. Classical political economy: value explained by exchange and circulation (money as measure within a system of representation); Modern political economy/Marxian analysis: focus shifts to production, labor processes, and historical conditions producing value.
      4. Emergence of “man” as object: in the Classical frame, the human is the speaking subject that uses the table; in the modern frame “man” himself becomes an historical, biological, psychological object studied (e.g. anthropology, psychology, sociology), produced by and intelligible within historical processes.
- It is comforting, however, and a source of profound relief to think that man is only a recent invention, a ﬁgure not yet two centuries old, a new wrinkle in our knowledge, and that he will disappear again as soon as that knowledge has discovered a new form.

- The history of madness would be the history of the Other — of that which, for a given culture, is at once interior and foreign, therefore to be excluded (so as to exorcize the interior danger) but by being shut away (in order to reduce its otherness); whereas the history of the order imposed on things would be the history of the Same — of that which, for a given culture, is both dispersed and related, therefore to be distinguished by kinds and to be collected together into identities.
