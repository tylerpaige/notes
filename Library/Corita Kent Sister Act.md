## Highlights
- Exemplifying Vatican II’s imperative to speak in the common language of the people, Kent’s work presented a world of profound religious significance lurking beneath the fleeting secular surfaces of the everyday. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1195939866/10750095))
- Colin McCahon ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1195939866/10750098))
- At first glance, her work looks like pop art—and the documentation of the Mary’s Day festivities she art directed may remind us of happenings (hippie be-ins, more like)—but, in her time, she was remote from the pop-art discussion, being understood and distributed more as a graphic designer.

- Kent pop artist belongs to a new idea of pop. She is a product of revisionism. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1195939866/10750100))
- Kent continued to reiterate brushstroke logic as shorthand for unmediated creativity, spontaneity, and freedom, personal expression and love. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1195939866/10750101))
- Irony was irrelevant to Kent, but crucial for pop. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1195939866/10750102))
- Perhaps her work anticipated slacktivism, our current habit of branding ourselves with righteous issues rather than actually doing anything about them ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1195939866/10750106))
- We’re able to cast her as epitomising a sea change in the Catholic Church and as a radical within it—whichever we prefer. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1195939866/10750116))
- In the beginning, pop art and abstract expressionism were polar opposites. However, as we increasingly engage with pop art independently of its formative issues with abstract expressionism, this oppositional characterisation loses its grip.

    - Note: this is the thesis
- God is everywhere: Kent finds him in the supermarket, Redford at the beach. And he is inescapable. It seems, the closer you get to the secular, the more you eliminate religion, the more religion raises its head. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1195939866/10750130))
