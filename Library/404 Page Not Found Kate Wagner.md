## Highlights
- Geert Lovink separated internet culture into three periods ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1174029601/10431986))
- The new internet knows this, and it capitalizes on my nostalgia as it eats away at the old interne ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1174029601/10431995))
- And this is especially true in an era where involuntary data mining, as opposed to voluntary participation, is king. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1174029601/10432025))
- Users, in other words, must now operate within the hell of beautiful interfaces designed by experts ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1174029601/10432053))
- In essence, the “glitter” produced by those who “pimp out” their MySpaces [boyd acknowledges the racialized attributes of this language] is seen by some in a positive light while others see it as “gaudy,” “tacky,” and “cluttered.” While Facebook fans loved the site’s aesthetic minimalism, others viewed this tone as “boring,” “lame,” and “elitist.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1174029601/10432595))
- But the thrill of making and discovering sites is not the same. The analogue organicism of finding something is no longer there—these were sites you “stumbled upon.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1174029601/10433370))
    - Note: I agree with this, but I don't know why? Finding a site where the entire packaging was unique felt special. Maybe because there was less infrastructure to tell you how famous it was. There were no visible metrics for followers and likes.
- Because websites had to either become apps or self-optimize for mobile, ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1174029601/10433390))
    - Note: Worth noting that there are significant strides to push for progressive web apps over standalone apps. There's complications therein, such as how companies like Google throw their weight around w/ PWA support and specification; but the change would be interesting. You could, theoretically, begin to re-introduce user code to PWAs.
      Still, the problem of security would exist. How do you allow people to put arbitrary code on their profiles without opening up security vulnerabilities. Lest we forget, crime on the internet is different now than it used to be. In addition to giving a "hellscape of beautiful design," the standardization of profiles—as well as the early college-only exclusivity—added legitimacy to pages. A college sophomore at Brown would not be likely to steal your credit card.
      Also propaganda! It would be interesting to hypothesize how propaganda would flourish in such a world.
- Hence, they think, because this stuff isn’t profitable, it must mean nobody wants to see it; ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1174029601/10433401))
- your own fingerprints ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1174029601/10433416))
    - Note: Ha. Funny. The power to individualize was not taken away. It was just reapportioned away from the users. Companies very much know the intricacies of the users' identities.
