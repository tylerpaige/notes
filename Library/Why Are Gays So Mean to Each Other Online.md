## Highlights
- “Content” is just something you post that no one pretends is art.
- amid the glut of falseness and pretense that dominates much of life online, we hunger for moments of “reality,” we also understand that those moments can become punishable offenses. “Reality” in this context, when it appears as an outlier, a goof, resembles a setup awaiting its punchline.
- Posting is a method of enacting a degraded version of that much-vaunted thing, community, with its ever-changing roster of winners and losers, in-groups and out-groups, and mean girls and sweet guys.
