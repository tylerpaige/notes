Summary: Aesthetic value is shrinking because new styles quickly become common and lose their novelty. The internet makes all aesthetics easy to see, which makes it hard for any one style to feel truly new. This change hurts artists and designers, who must work harder to stand out but earn less from their work.

## Highlights
- Where are avant-garde artists (early adopters) making new aesthetic movements happen, and what tools are they using? Turning to the far right side of the cultural normalcy spectrum may be useful. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvsj75hnc6n1vmj5fw23d5s))
    - Note: Lmao is he suggesting designers pilfer scant garde artists
- But we are interested in aesthetic novelty because we are interested in the limits of aesthetic production. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvqet8j0bt3wpcr3wg4wwp1))
    - Note: This sentence offers nothing about how these two ideas are reated
- Some independent broadcasting efforts such as zine culture did exist, but these networks were too limited in scale to be relevant to this discussion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvqgjxn3fe2995vzr77mj5s))
    - Note: Arbitrary
- But properly understood today, media institutions are not unitary organizations; they are concentrated collections of nodes with presences on aggregator platforms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf9keeb1ny0yarre7r3rkhpv))
- Everyone has equal access to every aesthetic. Media is available on demand, as opposed to the time-locked experience offered by traditional media. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvqry1qb2za91kdax5vzh3x))
    - Note: Blauvelt
- Aggregator interfaces impose uniformity of presentation (rectangular images with maximum size restraints), while positioning aesthetic artifacts above and below atomically unrelated items—other aesthetics, images and videos, the news, hot takes, memes, insights, personal updates, and so on. In short, the feed causes aesthetic relativism. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvqwcqq7dn1fdbsbdmxt1jj))
    - Note: Benjamin, author as producer, talking about newspapers
- For instance, universal asynchronous accessibility and low distribution cost means that *an* *aesthetic can never die.* Somewhere right now, someone is discovering [vaporwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaporwave) for the first time, and can contribute to its longevity by participating in a lively [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vaporwave/). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf9kj762vhhfeabhckk3d48s))
- he combination of ubiquitous exposure and the obliteration of predictable context desensitizes consumers to aesthetic novelty. Just as aesthetics can no longer truly die, it is now difficult to create an aesthetic that will be experienced as truly new. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvqw2s1xzzmbrxyzymjhbmq))
- This creates perverse incentives for everyone to follow the same people, so as not to miss out on what other people are looking at, which in turn creates aesthetic micro trendwaves following the release of anything somewhat novel. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf9kng4e045h6v2kz01a2f4z))
- the discipline of aesthetic production ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf9kq19f3caf4wg6z6qmc0cg))
    - Note: lol
- As their work is pillaged and reproduced downstream ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvr50wemcp3e0r4as2px84a))
    - Note: A lot of indignation in this phrasing 
      It’s just a bit of an eyeroll when someone can’t recognize that perhaps peoples work is converging because they are responding to similar things out because they share context. No one creates anything in a vacuum, not even these annoying egomaniac designer boys
- abandon the allure of an original practice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvr4c247ge6mmsttbfdgkx2))
    - Note: The obviously correct answer
- such insistence on original work ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvrdhjsq35s2k8jye17ekrh))
    - Note: Whose insistence? Yours? It doesn’t seem like Rudnick is insisting on originality
- In this environment, people cannot be expected to develop a novel aesthetic for every project. Subject to harsh competitive dynamics and incapable of being picky with clients, some designers can only view the struggle to maintain authorship as futile, cynical, and privileged. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvrcxk6bfs0etnqdwqc4m7p))
- Design to me is a synthesis of the message that must be shaped and the audience that must receive it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvrg372f9kdw3wxcx3h3a63))
- authorship is unlikely to be compromised, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvrznx318mtzn9hqyea25w8))
    - Note: This is a telling phrase. If the work isn’t original, then authorship is compromised. They have a built-in association between originality and authorship and the individual, even when they are making arguments to disentangle them
- because these two things are unique in every brief. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvrh9vp0yf52nd282qypq69))
    - Note: ???? No they aren’t 
      I mean I get what he’s saying… it’s basically form follows function — the brief comes first and then the work fits the brief. But like… a lot of products are offering the same exact thing to the same exact audience
- the author will always be present but hopefully invisible; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvrmg3sgqyrr1gfzm4j7caa))
    - Note: This is such a funny thing for a person with such a distinct style to say
      Also extremely bizarre because what does he think author means in this context?
- Eric refers to it as sincerity, hopefully my words above explain that I mean something similar when I use the term “Original”; its efficacy does not come from stolen visual flourishes or ego-presence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvrqvnnr2yeawc01eerh0js))
    - Note: So weird to me that these people can’t do away with originality/hero narratives without fully erasing the individual. It’s like a total binary. Why can’t we have Authors who attempt to find a personal voice, all the while maintaining that (A) the audience imparts the author’s decision making (B) the author desires to resonate with audience (C) the authors ideas are surely the product of being an audience to someone else. Why do I have to pretend that I am divining some mathematical best combination of message and audience? They treat this practice like a science
- I adopted systems of documentation that fingerprint the document-object (work 2) without changing its form-in-the-world (work 1), allowing a separation of tools for distinguishing authorship-in-documentation from the design-object itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfvsa4d5aate8b27f7j845t1))
- At the risk of repeating myself, casual broadcasting was not possible before the internet. The separation of broadcasters and consumers in the network meant that client funding or corporate backing was required to pay for the aesthetic production and distribution. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf9m3hys15q77wvhj39re6v9))
    - Note: Obviously the internet radically increased access to tools and to audience. No arguing against that point. But I think this description is a little inaccurate. The 60s–90s saw many, many independent publications. It was in fact a very diverse media landscape. And it wasn’t corporate-backed.
- If image and aesthetic production is a fully saturated behavior, we should expect to see that the market for aesthetics is no longer about disruptive, product-driven innovation but about sustaining, process-driven innovation characterized by [customer-stealing](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2014/04/24/product-driven-versus-customer-driven/) and market consolidation. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf9m9wcjc26kqcdp5tac4aqw))
    - Note: Q: What does the author mean by “process-driven innovation?”
      A: The author contrasts process-driven with product- or aesthetic-driven innovation: process-driven innovation focuses on improving how things are made, distributed, or monetized (sustaining efficiencies, customer-stealing, scaling, and consolidation) rather than inventing new, disruptive aesthetics or products; in the saturated image market, firms compete by optimizing workflows, brands, platforms, and business models rather than by producing radically novel visual styles.
      Q: Explain this more. The author constructed this sentence as a cause and effect (if this then that). Why? What does this cause produce this effect?
      A: The author frames it as cause→effect to show how changes in network topology (cause: ubiquitous, asynchronous, many-to-many distribution plus aggregator feeds) mechanically produce cultural outcomes (effect: desensitization to novelty, faster spread and perpetual availability of aesthetics, and therefore diminishing marginal value of new aesthetics). In short, increased access, zero‑marginal‑cost distribution, and flattened context make novel aesthetics both harder to distinguish and easier to copy, which reduces their ability to confer scarcity-driven cultural or economic value.
