Summary: People often romanticize the 1950s family but overlook that many women and children suffered poverty inside two-parent homes. Economic and political changes, not divorce or single parenthood alone, largely explain rising family poverty and inequality. Greater gender equality has improved options for women even as class divides make stable family life harder for less-educated groups.

## Highlights
- Chapter 3 discusses the origins, functions, and contradictions of such polarized ideas about gender. Far from being natural or traditional, the notion of males and females as opposites, with women focused on the family and men on the larger world, emerged only in the early nineteenth century, as the production of goods and services moved away from the household, thereby physically separating the work involved in raising and nurturing a family from the work involved in provisioning it.

- n most states, recipients can now get work credit for only one year of vocational training, so recipients trying to complete college lose child-care vouchers and cash assistance. The act also imposed strict lifelong limits on the amount of aid a family or individual can receive, no matter how long a person works between spells of hardship. And as of 2015, Congress had not adjusted the funding of the basic grant since 1996, causing its real value to fall by one-third.

- s I show in chapter 4, however, every American gets “free stuff” from government. The home mortgage interest deduction, which largely benefits the top 20 percent of income earners, now costs roughly the same amount as the food stamps program, about $70 billion a year. And a 2012 *New York Times* report calculated that federal and state governments had given away $170 billion in tax breaks and incentives to businesses without demanding any accountability as to whether they actually produced long-term jobs or even stayed around long enough to make up for the tax losses the communities incurred.

- In chapter 5, I show that not until the late nineteenth century were Americans urged to make the nuclear family the central locus for their loyalties and obligations. The new ideal was quite different from views of civic responsibility in the early republic, in which being a good “family man” was two steps below the most esteemed level of citizenship.

- Officials forced Native American extended families off their collective property and onto single-family plots. They made Indian men the public representatives of families, ignoring the traditional role of women in community leadership, and placed Indian children in boarding schools to eradicate traditional Native American values.

- In the twentieth century, immigration laws, tax policies, zoning regulations, unemployment insurance, and welfare policies were all constructed in ways that penalized family and household arrangements that did not conform to the male-breadwinner nuclear model.[40](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rfm1en40) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke2dggtn35px30tpkvnrpwnh))
- But we saw a similar development in the second half of the nineteenth century. As a long-established agrarian and village way of life was disrupted by the spread of wage labor, many young people also delayed marriage to what were then unprecedented ages, changing jobs and residences as frequently as most young people do today. And the “overdependence” on parents that many criticize in young people today seems fairly mild in comparison to the nineteenth-century intensity of mother-child ties. Young men carried pictures of their mothers off to war and wrote poems about missing the “caress” of their mother’s hair against their cheek. According to historian Susan Matt, many soldiers suffered such severe homesickness during the Civil War that military officials prohibited bands from playing “Home, Sweet Home” for fear it might make young soldiers literally ill from nostalgia for mother and home.[54](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rfm1en54) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke2dxqtenf33k8agzfxv48er))
- Chapter 9 discusses the cross-cultural variations and historical transformations in how “good parenting” is defined. It questions what Arlene Skolnick has called “the myth of parental omnipotence”—responsibility for everything good or bad about the way children turn out—along with the flip side of this idea, the notion that children today are beset with new dangers against which parents have little defense.

- But long-term follow-up studies have shown that children from the same high-poverty areas who had *not* been exposed to cocaine in utero were equally likely to have developmental and intellectual delays as the babies born with cocaine in their systems. The big risk to all these children, researchers now agree, was—and remains—poverty itself, which is an especially powerful toxin for the developing brain.

- In traditional families, my students write—half derisively, half wistfully—men and women remained chaste until marriage, at which time they extricated themselves from competing obligations to kin and neighbors and committed themselves wholly to the marital relationship, experiencing an all-encompassing intimacy that our more crowded modern life seems to preclude. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke37e7eseqqq18dzdh3e0gp2))
- By the end of the nineteenth century, shocked by the conditions in urban tenements and by the sight of young children working full-time at home or earning money out on the streets, middle-class reformers put aside nostalgia for “harnessed” family production and elevated the antebellum model once more, blaming immigrants for introducing such “un-American” family values as child labor. Reformers advocated adoption of a “true American” family—a restricted, exclusive nuclear unit in which women and children were divorced from the world of work.

- For now, I argue that our recurring search for a traditional family model denies the diversity of family life, both past and present, and leads to false generalizations about the past as well as wildly exaggerated claims about the present and the future.

- People born in the twentieth century are much more likely to live near their birthplace than were people born in the nineteenth century.[13](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rch1en13) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke385cbxkr83parn5x9580nk))
- In the late twentieth century, people move from job to job, following a career path that shuffles them from one single-family home to another and does not link them to neighborly networks beyond the family. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke3865s3pc256tzsrbcbkyhf))
- Americans describe their relationship with their mother as close, and 78 percent say their relationship with their grandparents is close. And for all the family disruption ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke386gk9zdtcr0wza7dg3nk6))
- The expectation that the family should be the main source of personal fulfillment, for example, was not traditional in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, as we shall see in [chapter 5](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Chapter005.xhtml). ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke38er92jxfbctxwqsk3e0mg))
- Civic festivals and Fourth of July parades were more important occasions for celebration and strong emotion than family holidays, such as Thanksgiving. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke38f61hrw01tpt95re8qydp))
- But there is no reason to assume the worst. Americans have actually gained free time since 1965, despite an increase in work hours, largely as a result of a decline in housework and an increasing tendency to fit some personal requirements and errands into the work day. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke38s1tcwj2kxjhx32x0ankq))
- Thus, at the same time as Americans report high levels of satisfaction with their *own* families, they express a pervasive fear that other people’s families are falling apart. In a typical recent poll, for example, 71 percent of respondents said they were “very satisfied” with their own family life, but more than half rated the overall quality of family life as negative: “I’m okay; you’re not.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke38t956vv8w7rvdm8rsrrfr))

- Although 87 percent of people polled in 1987 said they had “old-fashioned ideas about family and marriage,” only 22 percent of the people polled in 1989 defined a family solely in terms of blood, marriage, or adoption. Seventy-four percent declared, instead, that family is any group whose members love and care for one another.[30](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rch1en30) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke38w8pfdp05y2vaxqsgjtn2))
- Few Americans are satisfied with liberal and feminist accounts that blame all modern family dilemmas on structural inequalities, ignoring the moral crisis of commitment and obligation in our society. Yet neither are they convinced that “in the final analysis,” as David Blankenhorn of the Institute for American Values puts it, “the problem is not the system. The problem is us.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke38yyk9mps050207dqcj001))
- At the time, most people understood the 1950s family to be a new invention.

- The “good life” in the 1950s, historian Clifford Clark points out, made the family “the focus of fun and recreation.” The ranch house, architectural embodiment of this new ideal, discarded the older privacy of the kitchen, den, and sewing room (representative of separate spheres for men and women) but introduced new privacy and luxury into the master bedroom.

- Even at the end of the purge, there were more women working than before the war, and by 1952 there were 2 million more wives at work than at the peak of wartime production. The jobs available to these women, however, lacked the pay and the challenges that had made wartime work so satisfying, encouraging women to define themselves in terms of home and family even when they were working.

- In fact, the growing willingness of parents to subsidize young married couples and the new prevalence of government educational stipends and home ownership loans for veterans undermined the former assumption that a man should be able to support a family before embarking on marriage. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke57bt57ek460144c2y9drq0))
- The success of sexual containment depended on sexual inequality. Men no longer bore the responsibility of “saving themselves for marriage”; this was now exclusively a woman’s job. In sharp contrast to the nineteenth century, when “oversexed” or demanding men were considered to have serious problems, it was now considered “normal” or “natural” for men to be sexually aggressive. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke57ejxa1kxr0g9fjaez6xq8))

- More recent conservative writers—and even a few feminist ones—are equally adamant that American culture requires women to counteract male individualism. Allan Carlson, president of the Rockford Institute on the Family, argues that for capitalism to avoid self-destruction, the family must be walled off from competitive pressures, by government intervention if necessary ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke57m413qwt2wmkzcwn0qwha))
- According to some authors, this “natural” division of gender roles was the cornerstone of the *real* traditional family. It produced a sentimental, almost sacred, domestic sphere whose long-term commitments and nurturing balanced the pursuit of self-interest in the public arena. Recent social problems, they argue, stem from a self-defeating superegalitarianism that denies men’s and women’s differing needs and abilities and desanctifies family relations.

- Political and economic relationships came to be organized around the contractual rights of equal, independent individuals; only gender and family relationships remained organized around personal needs, individual differences, and dependence. This led to a growing divergence between politics, law, and economics—the site of competition and objective laws, men’s arenas—and interpersonal relations—the site of altruism and subjectivity, women’s arenas. It also created a polarization between public rights and private needs that eventually hampered people’s ability to develop a responsible approach to either. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke57wk7sypecn6qyh00dwcvb))
- Originally, male and female principles, public and private relations, were supposed to balance and complement each other.

- Modern American parents teach their children that they can be anything they want to be. In ancient Greece, such overweening confidence in the individual’s ability to shape his or her own fate was the sin of hubris, and it brought the protagonists of many Greek tragedies to bitter ends. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke581nx9264nckj5zajda6rt))
- The links between Enlightenment philosophy, Protestantism, antimonarchical revolutions, and market relations are multistranded and a subject of endless academic debate. Here, however, it is necessary to note only that none of these strands was separable from the rise of capitalism and the development of liberal ideology. Liberal ideology, in its original sense, was a doctrine that linked the concept of freedom to the pursuit of self-interest in a competitive market, postulating that men—I use the word advisedly—were rational egoists who could accurately assess that their long-term interest required the development of civic government and law. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke58d1hy7x9ayxsh6sk2vv2m))
- The triumph of contractual relations excluded philanthropy and moral concerns from economic behavior but elevated the importance of keeping commitments. The ideology of equal rights banished personal ties and pity from political transactions but demanded impartiality from those who enforced or regulated such transactions. Although a contract could no longer be broken by appealing to higher moral laws, changed circumstances, community custom, or personal sympathy, it could also not be evaded or weakened by distance in space or time. Thus, although liberal capitalism eroded the sense that elites were responsible for dependents, it at least initially increased the reach of social networks, because the social contract was said to apply to all. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke58fqdg03nm15drz3w07bd8))
- The tradition that contracts should be reviewed for their larger justice or morality was undermined, because whatever the parties agreed to was their own business.[18](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rch3en18) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5bs4hc23c2rk5nxvghed1g))
- liberalism reduced morality “to questions of legal and political procedures”; justice became focused “on due process, not on substantive ends.”[19](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rch3en19) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5btc2hatk8gc1c1asr52nt))
- Most Enlightenment and liberal thinkers gave only limited endorsement to individualism and privatism, insisting that these traits must be modified by universal reason. Hence the emphasis on education in Enlightenment philosophy: not, originally, as a means to personal mobility and economic success, as parents tend to justify education today, but as a way of reconciling individual liberty with social cohesion. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5cd4h5771bt4c52wyg81xg))
- Laws, regulations, and due process provisions were seen as *enhancing* individual rights by providing a secure framework for social cooperation, competition, and negotiation.[20](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rch3en20) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5cdvsp9s5zq8wdemwsvvsy))
- Increasingly, freedom was defined negatively, as lack of dependence, the right not to be obligated to others. Independence came to mean immunity from social claims on one’s wealth or time. Sociologist Robert Bellah and his collaborators analyze the dilemma that was inherent in the new ideology and that has become increasingly severe as traditional community counterweights to individualism have disappeared: “Freedom is perhaps the most resonant, deeply held American value. . . . Yet freedom turns out to mean being left alone by others, not having other people’s values, ideas or styles of life forced upon one.” But “if the entire world is made up of individuals, each endowed with the right to be free of others’ demands, it becomes hard to forge bonds of attachment to, or cooperation with other people, since such bonds would imply obligations that necessarily impinge on one’s freedom.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5ch77kv01n1fj6b4zjs5am))
- “Rights language offers a rich vernacular for the claims an individual may make on or against the collectivity, but it is relatively impoverished as a means of expressing individuals’ needs *for* the collectivity.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5cj8pnxhwpr3rzcnd0s9t2))
    - Note: Wow. I hadn’t really thought about the concept of “rights” as a framework might inherently foreclose certain possibilities, like collectivism.
- The precondition for “freeing” men from traditional obligations, hierarchies, and interdependencies to become individualistic economic and political actors was a magnification of women’s moral obligations and personal dependencies, both in the family and beyond it. Social historian Philippe Aries argues that with the rise of Enlightenment philosophy and the manufacturing system, previously “diffuse” obligations and emotions were increasingly concentrated in the family. At the same time, women’s work was more clearly demarcated from men’s, and middle-class women in particular were increasingly excluded from former occupations. They were assigned to domesticity inside the home and voluntary religious or charity work outside it.[24](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rch3en24)
  Self-reliance and independence worked for *men* because *women* took care of dependence and obligation. In other words, the liberal theory of human nature and political citizenship did not merely leave women out: It worked precisely because it was applied exclusively to half the population. Emotion and compassion could be disregarded in the political and economic realms only if women were assigned these traits in the personal realm. Thus the use of the term *individualistic* to describe men’s nature became acceptable only in the same time periods, social classes, and geographic areas that established the cult of domesticity for women. The cult of the Self-Made Man required the cult of the True Woman.[25](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rch3en25) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5d171xzjazwm39zbjh3bpk))
- Liberal politics and capitalist markets expunged particularistic ties, social obligations, and personal dependencies from their general operating principles (though it took much longer to expel them from daily transactions, especially at the local level). They redefined these behaviors as *family* functions and relocated them in love relations. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5d3c2srp9evkpkx5b71mrs))
- Women began to romanticize love and nurturing as female qualities that compensated for, or even outweighed, men’s political power and economic resources. Men began to romanticize women as givers of services and emotions that could not be bought on the open market or claimed as political tribute but seemed to flow from generosity and self-sacrifice rather than from calculation or exchange. One obvious problem was that as long as women were economically dependent on men, their “gifts” were the price they paid for food, shelter, and protection. Men were uneasily aware of the material considerations that contaminated a wife’s gift giving and altruism; that is why men’s greatest veneration of female self-sacrifice was often reserved for mothers and why deference to mothers has historically been compatible with contempt for other women. But at least in the courtship phase, male sentimentalization of femininity was generally applied to lovers as well. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5ddkpfnkhzstqyx1spzrry))
- Most children, Berger points out, are allowed to be dependent in relation to everyone. They are surrounded with the rights of dependence ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5dfjfdqqrsrs6qyd6zngab))
- As states adopted liberal values and organizing principles, they were forced to justify their demands on citizens less in terms of collective or communitarian goals than in terms of the necessity “to defend *private* interests and discharge *private* obligations.” The most emotionally compelling of those private obligations was protection of men’s dependents. Thus wars were increasingly explained as being fought for hearth and home, most especially “to protect our women.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5djjzvj2e7ta02ap2bcpxn))
- The doctrine of republicanism provided little justification *for forcing* women not to rely on themselves; it could only suggest that in reality they would be much happier if they did not—and would be more likely to find true love. But would they really? The doctrine of separate spheres gave men and women fewer and fewer areas of compatibility just as their relations were becoming more and more dependent on love. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5e23cmqqa2xgdc1kt4410k))
- The tendency of liberal states to justify war on the basis of “protecting our women” has often led men to wonder whether those women were worth the sacrifice. Historian Susan Gubar has noted recurrent themes in literature written during World War II of female ingratitude, male resentment of women’s helplessness, and men’s hostile determination to collect the sexual “rewards” due them for their labors on women’s behalf.[43](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rch3en43) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5e44gya0v93kgrb2520bwf))
- While some men are captivated by this one socially acceptable chance to abandon rationality and calculation, and therefore fall in love over and over again, for most men the ideal is to get out of the storm, to resolve the uncertainty, to be able to stop doing this foreign, threatening, and above all *distracting* emotional work.[47](private://read/01ke2ctn6mkm9q4k84extq3anv/Notes.xhtml#rch3en47) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5ebkzbeyap0tgsgpb7j62d))
    - Note: woah… this might be an interesting entrypoint to my own psychology…
- Since women have historically been expected to do the work of managing emotions, many have learned to read men, to interpret their non-verbal signals and ambiguous remarks, anticipating what men want or need and what will be unwelcome to them. Men have not been trained to interpret female signals with the same sensitivity, but rather to expect that women will reinterpret, make allowances for, translate into “prettier” form, or simply absorb men’s remarks and behaviors. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5efsgy93zw0fntfb2zvb5j))
- In the twentieth century, a recurring theme in rape and sexual harassment cases has been the notion that if a woman has ever departed from ideal behavior in any way, she has no real “womanhood” to be violated or offended. The wives and mothers of rapists almost invariably, and usually in good faith, defend them as the soul of chivalry—at least toward women who conform to the prevailing myths.
  Gender stereotypes about men create binds for them as well. One of the reasons that the majority of the homeless are men, and in turn that the homeless receive so little sympathy, is that men who cannot sustain an independent existence in the competitive world, like women who do not exhibit a dependent existence in the family, are often considered unworthy of sympathy or aid ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke5ej2bmjd5yprvhfcy1pjeh))

- It is important to note that the most dramatic growth in government social expenditures since the 1960s has been in social insurance programs, such as worker’s compensation, disability, and Medicare. Most benefits from these programs go to members of the white middle class. Although the programs are very important for the poor they do reach, even at the height of the Great Society antipoverty initiative, between 1965 and 1971, 75 percent of America’s social welfare dollars were spent on the nonpoor. The proportion going to the poor has decreased substantially since then. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ke8jvs25vd8xtgg7zt25pe6z))

Only then was women’s “moral ecology” reduced to the family’s own backyard. The doctrine of the private family as the center of morality and personal identity, a critical redefinition and contraction of older concepts, was established by a middle class that had retreated from larger ethical concerns.

  Serious public policy dilemmas are raised by these cases, but treating them solely as personal, moral, or maternal failures does not take us very far in our thinking. There was, for instance, a catch-22 for many modern mothers, just as there was for those accused of child neglect one hundred years earlier. By the end of the 1980s, growing numbers of pregnant women could not *find* prenatal care. To punish women for not getting prenatal care when we do not recognize public responsibility for providing it is uncomfortably close to the turn-of-the-century practice of penalizing poor mothers for not giving their children the benefits of affluence.

- As long as the idioms of love and family were engaged in a dialogue with those of politics, education, and economics, as in the republican era, notions of fraternity, justice, sisterhood, responsibility, and kinship could move back and forth between the two spheres, enriching both. Fraternity could be a model for revolution or antislavery work; sisterhood could inspire charity; conversely, liberty and justice could be claimed for the private sphere without fear that this would wipe out obligation and particularity. But, gradually, the two dialects diverged, until by the late nineteenth century a totally different language was used for each. As private family language monopolized the moral vocabulary that formerly had been utilized by a wide range of institutions, discussions of public life became more abstract and divorced from everyday experience.

Numerous observers have commented on the shrinking political universe in America during and after the election of 1896, as questions of economic justice and social morality were crowded off the political agenda by personal issues and abstract patriotic posturing.

    - Note: Q: what does the author mean by “new privacy “
      A: Coontz uses “new privacy” to describe a nineteenth-century legal and cultural shift where courts and institutions created a model of the middle‑class nuclear family as a discrete, autonomous private sphere—protecting its internal life from some external intrusions while simultaneously enabling reformers and state agencies to enforce middle‑class norms on poorer or nonconforming families.

      The new idea of privacy that courts gave to middle-class families in the 1800s
- The subjugation of families to public authority did not stem from a socialist or collectivist agenda but from an attempt to build individualistic definitions of private responsibility. Institutions fostered a form of personal responsibility that was especially geared to a competitive and structurally unequal economic order. Schools, for example, as Michael Katz comments, taught children “that helping your friends is cheating.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01keb1kj3ep2kkt9k5nynyx2ye))
- Since in both periods the family that reformers favored existed in only a minority of the population, the alternative to destroying other kinds of families was to help them achieve the middle-class, Protestant norm. The family preservation movement aimed to extend middle-class female domesticity and prolonged childhood to the working class. It was closely associated, accordingly, not only with legislation against child labor and attempts to limit the workforce participation of mothers, but also with social welfare measures designed to help families establish a modicum of privacy and domesticity. This commitment to the nuclear family and to female domesticity provided the first wedge for the expansion of state welfare agencies and federal regulation of the market—“state building for mothers and babies,” as political theorist Theda Skocpol puts it.
