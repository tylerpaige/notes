## Highlights
- Authorship may suggest new approaches to understanding design process in a profession traditionally associated more with the communication than the origination of messages. But theories of authorship may also serve as legitimizing strategies, and authorial aspirations may actually end up reinforcing certain conservative notions of design production and subjectivity — ideas that run counter to recent critical attempts to overthrow the perception of design based on individual brilliance.
- Foucauldian theory holds that the connection between author and text has transformed and that there exist a number of author-functions that shape the way readers approach a text. These stubbornly persistent functions are historically determined and culturally specific categories.
- Scientific texts, at least through the Renaissance, demanded an author’s name as validation. Far from objective truth, science was based in subjective invention and the authority of the scientist. This changed with the rise of the scientific method. Scientific discoveries and mathematical proofs were no longer in need of authors because they were perceived as discovered truths rather than authored ideas. The
- By the 18th century, Foucault suggests, the situation had reversed: literature was authored and science became the product of anonymous objectivity. When authors came to be punished for their writing — i.e. when a text could be transgressive — the link between author and text was firmly established.
- But Katherine McCoy’s prescient image of designers moving beyond problem solving and by “authoring additional content and a self-conscious critique of the message, adopting roles associated with art and literature,” is often misconstrued.
    - Note: Don’t know what this is referencing
- The rather dark implications of Barthes’ theory,
    - Note: Is Barthes’ theory dark? I have always read it as more “power to the people” — no individual alone constructs society, culture, and meaning; but rather it is the collective body that does. OTOH I suppose I can see a reading that’s like “communication is never guaranteed, thus everyone is an individual at risk of alienation because everyone is living in their own hermetic reality”
- (Keep in mind that although this example is a staple of critiques of modernism, in actuality the objectivists represented a small fragment of the design population at the time.)
- On the surface at least, contemporary designers were moving from authorless, scientific text — in which inviolable visual principles were carefully revealed through extensive visual research — toward a more textual position in which the designer could claim some level of ownership over the message. (This at the time literary theory was trying to move away from that very position.)
- emotions. In addition, most design is done in some kind of collaborative setting, either within a client relationship or in the context of a design studio that utilizes the talents of numerous creative people.
    - Note: I believe that today we can conceive as authorship as something that can be generated collaboratively, so I’m not sure how much water this argument holds. But I take his point: whereas previously stories were shared/cultural, now we have an idea that somebody came up with them.
- To call for the overthrow of authority — in the form of the author — in favor of the reader — read: the masses — had real resonance in 1968.
    - Note: yeah exactly, that’s how i read it. why does he call this idea dark?
- But to lose power you must have already worn the mantle, and so designers had a bit of a dilemma overthrowing a power they may never have possessed.
    - Note: That’s funny
- The interesting thing about the auteur theory was that, unlike literary critics, film theorists, like designers, had to construct the notion of the author. It was a legitimizing strategy, a method to raise what was considered low entertainment to the plateau of fine art.
- praised. (And, of course, that selective republishing of certain work to the exclusion of other work constructs a unified and stylistically consistent oeuvre.)
- The general authorship rhetoric seems to include any work by a designer that is self-motivated, from artist books to political activism. But artist books easily fall within the realm and descriptive power of art criticism. Activist work may be neatly explicated using allusions to propaganda, graphic design, public relations and advertising.
- By transferring the authority of the text back to the author, by focusing on voice, presence becomes a limiting factor, containing and categorizing the work. The author as origin and ultimate owner of the text guards against the free will of the reader.
- The longing for graphic authorship may be the longing for a kind of legitimacy, or a kind of power that has so long eluded the obedient designer. But do we get anywhere by celebrating the designer as some central character? Isn’t that what fueled the last fifty years of design history? If we really want to move beyond the designer-ashero model of history, we may have to imagine a time when we can ask, “What difference does it make who designed it?”
    - Note: i agree with this idea, but again i dont think of “Designer as author” as a power grab for celebrity. It really is just not about being a capitalist service desk.
- This is based on the assumption that the act of design is, in essence, the clarification of material or the remodeling of content from one form to another.
    - Note: so boring
- Designer as performer
- And the difference between the way different writers or designers approach situations and make sense of the world is at the heart of a certain criticism.
