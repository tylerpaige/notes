## Highlights
- Fisher employs his titular concepts to elucidate and extend Sigmund Freud’s theory of the uncanny. Discussing their implicit potentials in fiction, music, and film, Fisher argues that these affects can illuminate various egresses from a quotidian sense of reality—or, more specifically, drawing on Fisher’s conceptual armature, an escape from the ideological confines of “capitalist realism.” Such portals to the Outside are rendered terrifying in many of the fictions in which they appear, but “terrors are not all there is to the Outside,” Fisher argues. These encounters with the uncanny can just as readily be productive, encouraging us to think differently.
- As Fisher later wrote on his k-punk blog, many works of science fiction can demonstrate “that an enquiry into the nature of what the world is like is also inevitably an unravelling of what we are,” and the Ccru’s engagement with the Internet made this kind of enquiry all the more destabilising.
- And yet, although we look back on Y2K panic with a certain condescension, as a product of irrationality from a more naïve digital era, we can recognise how plenty of other new technologies make us anxious in similar ways, as we fear technology’s continuing effects upon our sense of what it means to be human.
- a “hyperstition”—a fiction that makes itself real?
- (As Lacan once proclaimed: “Every truth has the structure of fiction.”)
- Quickly popularised Internet phenomena, like memes or tools like ChatGPT, thus catch the waves of algorithms that are hooked on our most unconscious desires, as online culture is autogenerated by vaguely understood but nonetheless linguistically codified forces.
- They are attractive precisely because they allow us to relinquish a suffocating subjectivism, but their utterances may nonetheless come to control us in other ways.
