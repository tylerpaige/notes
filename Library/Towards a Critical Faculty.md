Summary: Art and design education needs a new approach that focuses on broad, cross-disciplinary "design thinking" rather than narrow specialisms. This new curriculum should help students become critical, thoughtful creators who understand culture and society deeply. Teaching should encourage reflexivity, enabling students to question and shape the future of their fields.

  In short, to foster a climate of progressive reflexivity.
  Educating reflexivity—teaching students to observe their practice from both inside and outside—fosters the ability to anticipate potential roles and their effects, so that upon entering the field, industry, market, academia, or whatever other facet of the after-school environment, they should at least be equipped to ask whether they

    - Note: more meta things to note
- The perceived payoff of unpacking “design thinking” is that its constituent qualities can be identified and extracted to provide the new focus of a contemporary art/design curriculum. This follows from the common intuition that existing models are incapable of accommodating the ever-blurring boundaries of art/design disciplines, of specialism giving way to generalism. The idea is that this so-called design thinking is transferable (or “exportable”) across disciplines, and so students ought to be taught to develop a general reflexive critical faculty rather than discipline-specific skills.

- The first key distinction was between the traditional master-apprentice model for craft-based professions (metallurgy, carpentry, etc.), and the academy-studio model for fine art training (drawing, painting, etc.) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01keswh2yr5x2f14y2sek4141a))
- The foundation of the School represented an important extension of the design philosophy of the Arts and Crafts movement which, largely inspired by William Morris, had raised the alarm against the lowering of standards as a result of the mechanization of design processes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvjhqvamp60xa9g3gvktg3))
- The majority of the staff of the school were not “certificated,” full-time teachers; rather were they successful practitioners in their respective crafts, employed on a part-time basis, and providing the school with a great variety of practical skills and invaluable contacts with the professional world of the designer and craftsman.

    - Note: I suppose this is saying that the first art schools had a faculty body that looked quite similar to adjuncting
- the switch from the traditional master-apprentice to the group-workshop model; the introduction of the foundation course of general principles for all fields; the application of fine art to practical ends; and the synthesis of the arts around one particular vision. Whether these ideas were actually realized or even consistent is irrelevant here; they endure as what the Bauhaus has come to represent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvkjxepmbm868gbkkwe45s))
- Apprentices were to be instructed not only by “masters’ of each particular craft but also by fine artists. The former would teach method and technique, while the latter, working in close cooperation with the craftsmen, would introduce the students to the mysteries of creativity and help them achieve a formal language of their own.

- I foresee that a whole group of you will unfortunately soon be forced by necessity to take up jobs to earn money, and the only ones who will remain faithful to art will be those prepared to go hungry for it while material opportunities are being reduced, intellectual possibilities have already enormously multiplied.

- There is no way to teach any person who lacks desire. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvmzn40qskw1hc3gz7a2hk))
- Art school students are marginal, in class terms, because art, particularly fine art, is marginal in cultural terms. Constant attempts to reduce the marginality of art education, to make art and design more “responsive” and “vocational” by gearing them towards industry and commerce have confronted the ideology of “being an artist,” the romantic vision which is deeply embedded in the art school experience. Even as pop stars, art students celebrate the critical edge marginality allows, turning it into a sales technique, a source of celebrity.

- It is based on the idea of students possessing a general creativity that spans disciplines. It is taught through the education of a medium as an autonomous entity, without emphasizing its lineage. And its method of teaching is by invention, involving the production of otherness and novelty. As such, it emphasizes formalism.

- Present-day ideas tend to be poured into the existing Bauhaus container, but they no longer fit. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvpbsamkmpxdgzmamtgq1c))
- students possess a general attitude that spans disciplines. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesxarfg2f9r3g7bpmd5bbm2))
    - Note: an “attitude” that spans disciplines rather than a “creativity” that spans disciplines… What’s the difference ? I suppose an attitude is like an outlook, a frame of mind, perhaps a conceptual framework. In other words, maybe “attitude” points more to the author’s critical position or politics. Contrast to that, “creative” refers to their aesthetic disposition — that their furniture looks similar to their product design looks similar to their paintings. Maybe?
- I prefer to keep De Duve’s chart intact and emphasize that his “deconstruction” refers to the intellectual unpacking, dismantling, and reading of a given piece of work. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvpk79pv4yweqng93b0c23))
- The back-end of this period—which brings us roughly up to date—has been further marked and marred, of course, by the propagation of school as business, student as customer, and all the attendant bureaucracy that instigates the ever-increasing gap between actual pedagogy and its marketed image.

- The fraying of any coherent consensus since the Bauhaus, further confused by the fact that policies are increasingly determined by schools’ financial departments rather than academic ones, has resulted in a largely part-time generation of itinerant teaching staff who lack the opportunities (time, energy, resources, community, encouragement, inclination) to engage in theoretical or philosophical grounding, while—as far I can see—*needing and wanting one*.

- An outdated implicit epistemology of design practice and intelligence, inherited from the nineteenth century. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ket2ghh7pqgz3r4ga0b2qtvt))
    - Note: 19th-Century Implicit Epistemologies in Design Practice: In the 19th century, designers often relied on tacit knowledge, craft traditions, and pattern-based reasoning rather than explicit scientific theories, so design decisions were guided by experience, apprenticeship, and shared professional norms. This implicit epistemology shaped furniture, architecture, and industrial design through rules of thumb, stylistic conventions, and material familiarity that were rarely written down but transmitted through practice. As industrialization progressed, these informal knowledge systems interacted with emerging formal methods, leading to hybrid practices and gradual codification of design principles.
      A old-fashioned way of thinking about how people design things and what intelligence means, based on ideas from the 1800s.

- and suggests that one key appropriate shift, already underway, is precisely that of dematerialization, away from a “product-centered attitude.” This implies the end of the product-as-work-of-art, heroic gesture, genius mentality and fetishism of the artifact. A more appropriate approach would focus more on the human context of the design “problem”; it would emphasize the design of services—whether post offices, hospitals, web providers, or indeed school bureaucracies—rather than material products; and in the face of overproduction and planned obsolescence, the systems that supplant the “vanishing product” would be approbated on sustainable, ecological grounds.

    - Note: I mean this makes sense. The US is more of a service economy than a manufacturing economy. It makes that our design pedagogy would relate to that transition. What does it really mean though?
- Throughout his attempt to grasp his precise relationship to these nascent traits, Calvino constantly invokes polar opposites.The most memorable and profound of these is the dualism of *syntony* and *focalization*—active participation in the world versus constructive meditation on it. The struggle to balance the two, he says, is prerequisite for the creation of culture. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvr9vn1bcfzekvdt67pdr9))
- There are many roles for designers even within a given sector of professional work. A functional classification might be: Impresarios: those who get work, organize others to do it, and present the outcome. Culture diffusers: those who do competent work effectively over a broad field, usually from a stable background of dispersed interests. Culture generators: obsessive characters who work in back rooms and produce ideas, often more use to other designers than the public. Assistants: often beginners, but also a large group concerned with administration and draughtsmanship. Parasites: those who skim off the surface of other people’s work and make a good living by it.

- *very one of them does many things well but one best: Each represents an archetype who builds a culture of creativity in a specific way. There is T*he Talent Scout*, who hires the über-best and screens ideas at warp speed.* The Feeder*, who stimulates people’s minds with a constant supply of new trends and ideas. T*he Mash-up Artist*, who tears down silos, mixes people up, and brings in outside change agents.* The Ethnographer*, who studies human behavior across cultures and searches for unspoken desires that can be met with new products.* The Venture Capitalist*, who generates a diversified portfolio of promising ideas that translate into new products and services.* (Conlin, 2006) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvs7c8e47eatsgkgh0jmn0))
- it’s worth pointing out that the rhetoric and attitude of the first is geared towards accommodating demand, concerned with some vestige of imperative needs while that of the second is geared towards creating demand, which doesn’t pretend to fulfill anything other than gratuitous needs. In other words, the former attempts to maintain (big-C) Constructive principles, while the latter is resolutely resigned to (small-c) commodification.

- Similarly, when real participation is side-stepped, and education is accepted lovelessly as a handout, then reality can seem progressively more fraudulent. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvsv5929b2kx58snb6ysks))
- Fortunately, the veriest beginner can draw confidence from the same source as a seasoned design specialist, once it is realized that the foundations of judgement in design, and indeed the very structure of decision, are rooted in ordinary life and in human concerns, not in some quack professionalism with a degree as a magic key to the mysteries. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvszqrjzkwj0cgyrywf9z6))
- We no longer have any desire for design that is driven by need. Something less prestigious than a “designed” object can do the same thing for less money. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvt8pdqt377c4ngsyajbpx))
- If the design is in fact the aesthetic refinement of an invention, then there is room for debate about what the “design problem” is. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvtf9mqeak3smwefzyht06))
- Education is therefore a form of optimism that gives our field a future by trusting the students to see, think and do things we cannot. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvtstb0mdxbscc1rx0m6ws))
- It is not enough for us to give each of them expertise in the current state-of-the-art. We have to give them the capacity to change the discipline itself, to completely define the state-of-the-art. More than simply training the architects how to design we redesign the very figure of the architect. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01ket990sdtvkgjt6qznkkt86j))
- The lingering notion here is that the systematic exploration of elemental principles (shape, colour, texture, contrast, pattern, etc.) via practical exercises can be usefully applied to any medium. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvtzznvw8fc02wb8ztebam))
- From this vantage, the idea of focusing on a more transferable “design thinking” implies not only easy communication and movement between disciplines (both physically and bureaucratically), but also integration with the broader social sciences (philosophy, sociology, cultural studies) in view of what Potter described earlier as knowing “the present as a commitment in depth.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kesvv7cmkmrvqcvtdg5jg1m8))
