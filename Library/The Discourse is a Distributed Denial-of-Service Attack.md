Summary: The Discourse is like a big online attack called a Distributed Denial-of-Service. It overwhelms websites with too much traffic. This makes the site slow or stop working.

## Highlights
- William James, writing in 1890, called this "the effort of attention." He noted that sustaining it was one of the hardest things a mind could do. The effort of attention could only be maintained for a few seconds at a time before the mind wandered off to do something else. Sustained concentration was really a series of these efforts, renewed again and again, each time pulling the mind back to the object of focus.

- The old media ecosystem had gatekeepers, and those gatekeepers were often stupid or corrupt, but at least the stupidity and corruption were bounded. There were only so many column inches in the New York Times, only so many minutes of evening news. A finite supply of attention-worthy items existed, and someone had to decide which ones made the cut. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfd7c2fah0d5w9bwj80kkqg1))
    - Note: I wonder if some of my phone-related anxiety was just from the never ending nature of it. There were times when I felt I had curated my algorithm to give me good stuff about art, nature, technology — as opposed to politics, discourse, etc. But it still left me feeling pretty hollow.
- It might look like a world where the most engaged and informed citizens are, paradoxically, the least capable of careful reasoning, because they've spent so much cognitive energy responding to controversies that they have none left for contemplation.

- Neil Postman argued in 1985 that television was creating a culture where everything became entertainment, including serious matters that deserved more somber treatment. His book *Amusing Ourselves to Death* made the case that we'd been so worried about Orwell's dystopia, the boot stamping on a human face forever, that we'd missed Huxley's sneaking up on us from the other direction. We would be destroyed by what we loved, not by what we feared. The problem wasn't that Big Brother was watching us; it was that we couldn't stop watching Big Brother.

    - Note: Seems relevant to my recent notes about the assertion that social media has no economic incentive to monitor mis/disinformation or attention farming. This is only true if you think of social media as an entertainment platform. If it is an information platform, it absolutely has the same economic incentive that journalism does (which might be none at all too lol)
- And because the controversies are endless, because there's always another one queueing up behind the current while you're still processing the last three, the effect is a constant low-grade cognitive emergency. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfd7vkw49j6h079zbpafvyr1))
- But we've built a machine that lets us hear that roar, or at least a curated selection of it, delivered directly to our phones at all hours. And while we haven't gone mad exactly, we've developed something like a collective attention disorder. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfd7ycxr3xrajysp3kx2xqbh))
    - Note: I wonder if this really happens to a majority of people. Or is it a subset of left-leaning profiles. Do regular 40-year old moms get the outrage machine?
- The knee-jerk objections misunderstand my point completely. I'm not saying the topics are unimportant. I'm saying the structure of the discourse prevents us from thinking well about even the most important topics. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfd81nq8wv4g3sm94291qjnw))
    - Note: I am thinking her about strong theory and weak theory. Perhaps part of the problem is that we are thinking about every crisis individually, instead of seeing them as networked effects of fewer larger crises.
- One of the main functions of experts in a healthy epistemic ecosystem is to compress information. A good scientist knows a lot of facts about X, but more importantly they know which facts matter, how different pieces of evidence fit together, and where the genuine debates are versus where there's solid consensus. When you ask an expert a question, you're essentially borrowing their cognitive labor. They've already done the hard work of understanding the subject, so you don't have to.
  But the discourse hates expertise. Or rather, it puts experts in an impossible position. To engage with the discourse, an expert has to compress their nuanced understanding into takes that can compete with the confident nonsense being spouted by random accounts with anime avatars. This compression loses most of what makes expertise valuable in the first place. The expert ends up sounding just as confident and simplistic as everyone else, because that's the only way to be heard. Meanwhile, the expert's nuance and uncertainty get interpreted as weakness or evasion. Why won't they just give us a straight answer? Probably because they're captured by some special interest, or because they're part of the establishment cover-up, or because they're just not very good at their job.

    - Note: Regarding generalism as a trait of contemporary culture
- This creates a vicious cycle. Experts withdraw from public discourse because it's frustrating and unrewarding, which leaves the field to confident non-experts and degrades the quality of public understanding, which makes it even harder for experts to engage productively when they do try to participate. The result is an environment that's actively hostile to expertise while claiming to value science and evidence. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfd8f0b36z4ksq02ngt3wfa5))
    - Note: Would love a citation here
- The more aware you are of everything, the more paralyzed you become. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kfd8hf6n5n5hvdr3vezd8agy))
