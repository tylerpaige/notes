## Highlights
- Is it only within a culture that fetishizes corporate branding that logos have become so visually banal and empty? Or does this dilution stem from something deeper?
- Although there were previously existing trademarks, many say that Behrens created the first complete branding system in 1907 for the electric company Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (AEG)—one of the largest manufacturing companies in the world at the time—through logo, posters, architecture, and product design.*
- Graphic design isn’t exactly rocket science, but in this document, the design process is both erased and somehow elevated to the actual heights of rocket science, philosophy, and even metaphysics.
- What this PDF reveals is that the practice of graphic design was taken from designers long ago—at least in larger corporate settings—and handed over to marketing departments, creative directors, and advertising agency CEOs.
- The late-stage capitalist creation of bullshit jobs and endless meetings hasn’t spared graphic design and graphic design shouldn’t spare corporations, either.
- If we are to reclaim logos from the committees and agencies, we must break free from the grip of neoliberalism and rediscover our artistic and cultural value.
