## Highlights
- Knowledge drives the graphic design machine, and to repair its mechanisms, we must scrutinize education. The current state of graphic design education is fragmented and poorly equipped to meet the needs of today’s practitioners or aspiring designers. It is scattered into overpriced private art schools, free online resources, and influencers attempting to bridge the gaps with their often inadequate, pay-to-play courses.
- For example, elevating state schools and community colleges to the ranks of wellregarded design schools—by having well-known faculty take positions at these institutions and enhancing their standing in the eyes of the broader design community—can only be beneficial.
- When it comes to aesthetic choices in the practice of graphic design, there can be two types of designers: those who seek to make themselves known and those who do not. The graphic designers who strive for anonymity—despite the inevitability of authorship, the myth of neutrality, and the guarantee of bias—serve a logical function in the design world. These designers excel in system-based work, such as signage, government form layouts, and UX design, where their focus is on usability and creating frictionless experiences.
- The other aesthetic path for graphic designers—the one where we accept that there will always be a personal intermediary between information and its dissemination—is where aesthetic shifts begin to flourish. Graphic designers will always “be in the way,” whether they want to be or not, and embracing this can only make the world more unexpected and beautiful.
- This is not to suggest that graphic design should be solely about self-expression (as it is not inherently art), as one of its key principles is that it is created with and for others.
- So, in what ways can graphic designers gain more respect within society? The most “successful” graphic designers are rarely the ones who produce the best work; they are the ones who can best advocate for themselves, demonstrate their value, educate their peers, and successfully justify their work to the world. While these are not skills that come naturally for everyone, they should be embraced.
- Those who rise to the top are the ones who play the game best, not necessarily the ones doing the best work.
