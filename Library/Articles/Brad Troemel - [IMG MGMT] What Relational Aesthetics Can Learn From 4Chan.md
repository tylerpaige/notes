## Highlights
- Bourriaud understands each as methodological equals, calling them “semionauts”. He uses this term to define those who create pathways through culture by reorganizing history to bring forward new ideas[4].
- Peter Bürger’s description of the avant-garde’s intention to merge everyday life with the aesthetic realm.
    - Note: off-topic but is the collapsed distinction between art and graphic design nothing more than the avant-garde’s success?
