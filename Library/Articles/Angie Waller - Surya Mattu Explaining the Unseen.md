## Highlights
- Complexity arises from simple rules because of information. Information isn’t just a human construct—it’s a fundamental property of the universe. It seems obvious, but DNA is information. Scientists describe it as an emergent property. So information is not confined to tweets from Elon Musk or something like that. Understanding the world and processing information is something all living beings do.
- I focus more on the process and the joy of making rather than just outcomes. Early in my career, I felt like I had to prove something or build a reputation. Now, I value the act of creating in and of itself. I am happy to sit, think, and build things.
- At ITP, I could match network names to people I knew—creating “portraits” of their movements. I could tell when someone was dating someone else or had attended a conference just from their Wi-Fi history.
