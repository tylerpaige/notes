## Highlights
- Initiated with considerable institutional and financial support, the Center produced artworks, exhibitions and public programs often accompanied by a poster or publication.
    - Note: who wanted this?
- It was not simply the graphic design nor the typography that caught me - rather it was their mode of production. The design of the posters changed sporadically as new designers or administrators appeared, but what remains the same is the way in each self-consciously incorporates its production method into the design.
- in the School of Architecture
- extending experimental and educational experience into work relationships,
- am, of course, struck by the ways in which this recent past becomes so quickly inaccessible in a digital medium.
- Beginning on a freelance basis,
- Muriel continually reevaluated how to make the conditions for making good design work possible.
- This constant interrogation of the near-future as a tangible present, as a practical lens for producing in the present powered a lot of Muriel’s best work.
- When she finished the book in 1968, she was left with the ethical residue of the Bauhaus and a clearer idea about teaching, production, practice and the mutually dependent relationships between them.
- experiments in IBM Selectric typesetting, computerized layout and other modes of book production
- Muriel had already been teaching at Massachusetts College of Art, but she was frustrated at how undergraduate design students froze when beginning an assignment. As soon as they were put into a situation of hands-on production such as using a photocopier or making monoprints, they became considerably more free. Muriel was convinced that a workshop environment, where teaching happens in a feedback loop with hands-on production and design would work well. Ron’s significant technical background in printing, photography and, increasingly, computer programming plus access to an offset printing press made this possible. Muriel described the goals of the Messages and Means course as:
- it. Opening up access to this instrument, students were able to explore an intimate and immediate relationship to the means of production for their design work. The inevitable result was a merging of roles and blurring of specializations. In the workshop, students became editors, platemakers, printers, typesetters and designers all at one time, in overlapping and iterative configurations.
- During the Independent Activities Period of January 1976, a group of (perhaps) over-zealous students took matters into their own hands to re-model this unfortunate architecture, demolishing a wall that stood between the two rooms.
- In this space, the activities of designing, teaching and producing became increasingly indistinct.
- The Visible Language Workshop, a unique interdisciplinary graphics laboratory, was founded to explore verbal and visual communication as information and as art on both personal and public levels. The synthesis of concept and production processes is informed by tradition and technology. [6]
    - Note: as both art and information
- “Workshop” described a space of production that was integral to the space of teaching and of design. By
- If the Bauhaus workshops were an attempt to come to terms with the conditions of industrialized production, then the Visible Language Workshop was an attempt to confront informationalized production.
- The shift from a mechanical to an information society demands new communication processes, new visual and verbal languages, and new relationships of education, practice and production. [6]
- the principle that reading and writing together form a new, autonomous language system.
- computer programmer Ken Knowlton of Bell Laboratories on computerproduced grey scales;
- and critic R.C. Kennedy exploring the diagrammatic languages of Marcel Duchamp.
- As a name, the Visible Language Workshop was almost perfect - joining the legacy of the Bauhaus with the contemporary concerns of a graphic design practice in the midst of substantial change.
    - Note: what was the change in 1975? sort of interesting to make this claim because people also say it radically changed in the 80s–90s, and again now in the 2020s. I suppose it’s always undergoing change!
- The final version of the VLW in the Media Lab was explicitly focused on developing new computer interfaces.
- The Media Laboratory is a pioneering interdisciplinary center that is a response to the information revolution, much as the Bauhaus was a response to the industrial revolution.
- user, rather than the designer controls the sequence and meaning of its contents.
    - Note: active position vs passive position
- I’m reminded that Muriel’s greatest asset may have been her refusal to specialize.
