## Highlights
- “pareidolia,”
- Those who say, “it’s so over” while posting the ugliest image ever imagined by AI clearly don’t know good art.
- My first reaction when I realize an image has been made by AI is simply, “This was made with AI,” and that kills all other feelings I may have otherwise had about the image.
- It only makes sense that it has become the official aesthetic of America’s fascist downward turn, or as technology writer Charlie Warzel puts it, “The MAGA Aesthetic Is AI Slop.”2
