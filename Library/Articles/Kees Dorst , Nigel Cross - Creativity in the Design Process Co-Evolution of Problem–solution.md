- Summary: Study of nine designers shows creativity arises when the design problem and solution evolve together. Defining and reframing the problem helps produce original ideas. Creative breakthroughs happen when a key concept links problem and solution, creating surprise and originality.

## Highlights
- As it turned out, the ‘ergonomics’ judgement correlated most heavily with the ‘total judgement’, and ‘creativity’ correlated least ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k9mwmj82mkgenjxd1gn04645))
- It is interesting that they all seemed to think that this was an original concept. Indeed it was original in the sense that it is a different concept from the existing litter bin; it was also original to each individual designer.

- (This is an instance of Boden's[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142694X01000096/#BIB12) distinction between ‘personal’ creativity and ‘historical’ creativity; where the latter type represents genuinely unique insights that occur to the first-ever individual in history known to have the insight.)

- It seems that creative design is not a matter of first fixing the problem and then searching for a satisfactory solution concept. Creative design seems more to be a matter of developing and refining together both the formulation of a problem and ideas for a solution, with constant iteration of analysis, synthesis and evaluation processes between the two notional design ‘spaces’—problem space and solution space.

- A rough description of what happened in this case is that a chunk, a seed, of coherent information was formed in the assignment information, and helped to crystallise a core solution idea. This core solution idea changed the designer's view of the problem. We then observed designers redefining the problem, and checking whether this fits in with earlier solution-ideas. Then they modified the fledgling-solution they had. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01k9mx0wbpnqywf11yxc55bfzv))
