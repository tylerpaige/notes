## Highlights
- Cultural researcher and ethnographer Whitney Phillips has noted that people are more likely to share and engage with content online because they want to create and perform a political identity. Identity and community are at the heart of meme culture. Phillips has proposed that we think about fake news more as folkloric news—or “folk news”—to focus on motivations rather than accuracy. It’s not that content online can’t be true or false; it’s just that we’re missing the bigger picture when we think just about factual accuracy.
- In one simple example, Renner pointed out that people shared articles on Breitbart less frequently than they viewed the images the site shared to accompany each article. Each image contained a simple array of statements and figures and pointed back to the article, and these images got way more traction than the articles themselves.
    - Note: Evidence that we live in an image mediated world, even today (although this article is from 2019, and the 2022 public release of LLM consumer tools definitely marked a shift in image-mediation)
- Researching social media–based propaganda in Russia,
    - Note: I never really thought about how other countries experience disinformation campaigns. Does it always look the same as the U.S.? Are there some countries who are so small and insignificant to global politics that their electoral politics are spared from disinformation campaigns? Probably not I'd have to guess and for two reasons:
      1. Firstly it seems likely that any individual country probably has multiple political parties who are vying for power and so one or more of those political parties could be the source of the disinformation campaign. In other words the U.S. definitely has disinformation campaigns from international sources but that's not a strict requirement.
      2. The second reason is that all politics are kind of globalized I think so a person in Liechtenstein is probably affected by disinformation campaigns in the U.K.
- The agency uses all the tools that activists have had at their disposal, like Photoshop and video editing tools, to test and disseminate messages online.
    - Note: I wonder if there are publicly available and maybe even open-sourced programs that propagandists use to measure the efficacy of their disinformation campaigns. If there are it would be interesting to do a technique and a clinical analysis of them. It might also be interesting to know if they use really standard social media monitoring tools.
- a strong visual aspect
    - Note: So interesting because many memes in right-wing publications have really terrible design. 'Strong' in this context does not mean well-designed. It means something else.
