- Summary: This article explores how far-right groups imagine using 3D printing to challenge current political and economic systems. It shows that these groups see 3D printing as a tool to avoid regulation and promote their agendas. The main impact of 3D printing is its potential to disrupt governance and create new social and economic orders.

## Highlights
- This article takes the disruptive position of additive manufacture as a given fact, and moves to expand upon the facility that 3D printing may have in future disruptions, particularly in terms of the effects that it has within politicised communities.

- The importance of Benkler’s observations lies in the way in which production systems operate outside of their relationships with different types of structuring systems, whether that be between state and market, church and union, or otherwise.

- As the research developed, however, the ethnographic approach framing the initial foray proved to be less effective than expected, primarily due to the fact that open access to many of the surveyed forums mitigated the need for interviews or covert approaches.

- Boltanski and Chiapello (2005) describe the presence of a ‘projective city’: a catchall term for types of imagined future society that colours contemporary behaviour, primarily of workers within capitalism. The projective city is not one city or another, but an idea of a utopia thrust forward into the future—both a project for now, and projected polis.

- It is within Hage’s framework of the political imaginary, and Boltanski and Chiapello’s projective city, that I analyse the discussions online, in order to unpack future expectations of 3D printing by the far right. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf3gn53jwp48yyz7s2xvd4p6))
    - Note: Okay so this article is not necessarily about how through groups are using 3D printing but rather how they instrumentalize the concept of 3D printing to imagine futures.
- 3D printing is disruptive whether or not societal changes that have been associated with it ever materialise ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf3gsysggt60qy98s2snxekv))
- One of the most disruptive elements of 3D printing may be in the fact that it is not sufficiently dealt with in existing intellectual property law ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf3gx7b0ygbpvzhw98j0yj6r))
- Tronti’s thoughts were forged within the repressive state operations of Italy’s post-war era, and his ideas, along with those of many others, were formed from a fervent re-reading of Marx. Agamben, on the other hand, cultivated his thought within the literary scene, among author Italo Calvino, ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf3h3ncy23a9j73anrxarvy5))

- Agamben’s response to this situation was to produce a series of books and articles dedicated to a theoretically complex assessment of the relationship between subject and state over the centuries. As Nicholas Heron notes, this task is primarily directed at undermining Foucault’s historicity of governmentality, sovereignty, discipline, and biopolitics, and showing that the function of all these forms of power have existed for many centuries ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf3h6084wyxe8eehpp9267n3))
    - Note: Interesting! I haven’t heard of this. Maybe I should read.
- The economy, for Agamben, holds a role as a key tool for the ordering of societies and peoples. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf3h7x6f6vjz1y2t5xh8p9te))
- In this frame of analysis, the economy is thus the site of contestation, but is not contested over simply for gains in power, but for determining the proper ending of the history either in a utopia or a dystopia. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf3hgeg640w1dkwej7xjg4wk))
    - Note: According to Agamben, people are “in conflict” about the economy because the economy is central to their conception of some future “end point,” which might be a utopia or dystopia
      By “in conflict” I mean that people practice politics 
      By “end point” I mean the “end of history” as in the imagined conclusion to the historical narrative. This refers to the feeling that progress has stopped and that things will henceforth no longer change
- relates strictly to the changes in domestic additive manufacture, in terms of how political actors understand the way that 3D printing provides a new economic arrangement, and in turn, changes what political outcomes can be organised or need to be prevented. This creates one goal for the analysis in this article - to ask what new imaginary political situations have arisen by virtue of 3D printing, in terms of their explicit or implicit goals.

- The factory society is the assessment of the way in which capitalism leads large networks of people to provide the cultural or informational basis of production without being paid. The goal is to examine the relationship that social life has with capitalist production, and the core of the idea is that the stochastic encounters that we experience as social beings in the world feed into the labour that we perform in the workplace. Our social lives become the means of production for the production of commodities, if not through our own work, then certainly through another’s. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf3hveg35f9cjwdzw20m7rj3))
- The factory society is an attempt to account for the observed increase in cultural labour, largely aligning with Marx’s prediction of the increasingly organic ratio in the composition of capital. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf3hyjy1yvqrfmmytrpwcsb8))
    - Note: q: What is Marx’s concept of the organic ratio in capitalist production?
      a: Marx’s organic composition (or ratio) of capital is the relation between constant capital (means of production: machinery, buildings, materials) and variable capital (labor power); it expresses how production becomes more capital-intensive over time as the proportion of constant capital rises relative to living labor, which underpins his argument about a falling rate of profit.
- The factory was an important site for the members of *operaismo* and *autonomia*, in that it is both the space of oppressive bosses, as well as a laboratory for experimenting with resistance and new forms of organisation. The conditions of the factory were hostile enough for workers that resistance movements developed and, as Michael Hardt notes, the factory became a laboratory for testing new social formations (Hardt 1996). The factory society is thus repressive in that it subordinates all of society towards commodity production, but in this same move, it makes the whole of society capable of resistance to capital.

- In Cyber-Marx, Nick Dyer-Witheford discusses the potential for a Marxist uptake of the home computer as a chance for a revolutionary, rather than reformist, economy, but notes that the emergence of home computing came at the same time as the end of ‘actually-existing socialism’. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kf3j6znsc9jksxbecf0q4rk8))
- The problem for the concept of the social factory is that in the case of 3D printing, the political economic split does not necessarily exist. A person can both be in charge of their creative thoughts, and produce immaterial designs and material objects on the basis of those thoughts. Despite this, the superficial control over the political economic association between the various means of production is complicated by the needs of a printing material that is external to the system. Whether the printer uses metals, plastics, or paper, these materials must be sourced from the marketplace, and must be paid for with money, and thus the fundamental distinction does not disappear. What the social factory exposes in this case, however, is a potential for the development of new material economies that do not communicate through a marketplace, but are still capable of communicating with each other.
