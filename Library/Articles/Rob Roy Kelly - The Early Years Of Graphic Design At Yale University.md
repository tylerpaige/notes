## Highlights
- This direction is readily understood because of their newfound expertise with a copy-camera.
- Typography was taught as a minimal art—you did not change typefaces or sizes if priorities could be established through leading or placement.
- The “color” or “texture” of text was an important consideration.
- Most students became avid collectors of display types. These were recorded on 4 x 5 ortho film negatives and kept in files.
- Treating the program of study as a whole strengthened the interrelationships between the various areas and, combined with team-teaching of sorts, made graphic design at Yale different from design instruction at the majority of other schools during that period.
- Combining undergraduate with graduate students and holding critiques in the studio opened up all critiques and discussions to all students.
- Admission policies permitted individuals to be accepted into the program who previously had not taken art or design. The main criteria was that they were bright, motivated, and knowledgeable in their field.
- The earlier strategy for admissions into graphic arts at Yale had been to create an environment that would nurture graphic designers without predicting which students eventually would develop into designers. I think the policy of accepting talented students from a variety of disciplines was lost over a period of years, and in my opinion, it took something very vital away from the overall program.
