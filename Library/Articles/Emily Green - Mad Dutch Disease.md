- Summary: Dutch Design is known worldwide for its clever, ironic, and sometimes difficult style. It reflects Dutch values like efficiency and social commitment but also shows a tension between creativity and branding. Today, Dutch designers often focus on small, ironic projects and question their role in shaping real-world change.

## Highlights
- That official sanction of Design as a valid, vital cultural activity seems to create an atmosphere here wherein designers actually consider themselves valid, vital contributors to culture. This is not always the case in America, where designers tend to be much more insecure about our professional value. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg1bs6ke56e3ycbjytzw9jeb))
- In America, if something challenging is designed, it says: “Your government wasted YOUR hard-earned money on something as frivolous as this.” In America color is waste. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg1bvgp6mcnym9em7t5yd1rz))
    - Note: so funny because everyone knows that every government contractor charges like 10x their normal rates. somthese ugly buildings are also wasteful
- So much Design in one place creates an aggregation of exacerbated difference. I wonder now, after a twenty-year ejaculation of making, whether individual design doesn’t need to signify anything anymore; it simply needs to look different from other designs. In that way, design shifts from ideology to a kind of branding strategy and enters its fully linguistic state. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg1bz67qq27e3jhkt9csxq8p))
- The Dutch remade modernism in a more eclectic, more tolerant version. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg1c4bkcvybjbxc40y13bw5e))
- If the most staid organization of any state, the central bank, is sponsoring design like that, what is left to rebel against? In America we still feel it’s our duty to try to inject good design into the fabric of a culture that is generally resistant to it. In Holland that cultural fabric is saturated, and it’s a small country. But are all big projects done? Is Holland a country where EVERYTHING is already designed?

- This disintegration of distinction does not in any way lessen the real ideological differences between the two men in 1972, but instead demonstrates the way in which the visual expressions of ideology have been absorbed into one master system that strips the meaning of all aesthetic gestures and reduces them to easily exchanged visual clichés. (See, for instance, Experimental Jetset’s ideology-free regurgitation of Crouwel’s work. It’s not accidental that the political power of the original work has been replaced by a history of conflicted dramatic “personalities.”) ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg1chkbxnee0xwvgcpap7qjy))
- associate with Studio Dumbar meant adopting certain values suggested by Dumbar’s own mythmaking apparatus: basically a systematic modernist approach to corporate identity peppered with a sprinkling of playful design elements. This approach allowed conservative, often privatizing clients to have it both ways: Dumbar seemed to promise both efficiency and individuality or freedom.

- Branding is a late-cycle phenomenon, the next step once the thing itself is no longer enough. When the consumer needs added impetus to choose one more or less equivalent product over another, the package becomes almost as critical as the product.

- The privatized standard-bearers of the Dutch culture repackage the emblems of Dutchness as a branding strategy to maintain the loyalty of their consumers (the contemporary word for citizens). So Dutchness, and Dutch Design, become tools for globalized, capitalist corporations to market to the Dutch audience. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg1d1teh0pc02kbe9s9xvzm3))
- To assuage, or at least to mask, the ambition and ego necessary to build the figure of the author, the Dutch designer positions him/herself not as originator, but as one who marshals undeniable economic, legal, textual, demographic and civic forces and follows them to their irrefutable conclusion. By this technique, the designer eschews celebrity, feigns anonymity, and assumes the role of systems manager. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg1dnee2yfxzbfqqb9mb8dpr))
    - Note: interesting perspective if nothing else… i suppose he’s describing “critical distance” (which Rita Felski more persuasively describes as a style in its own right)
      btw this guy is obsessed with ego,
- Perhaps many of the novel shapes of recent Dutch buildings can be attributed to this devotion to the diagram, and the authorial absolution it grants. By taking traditional Dutch pragmatism to absurd, deadpan extremes, the designer generates new, wholly unexpected forms. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg1e4kjfxabbkpcdg5ybcx0m))
- But if it is a Dutch Design trait to disappear into data or a system and feign, at least, a lack of real ambition or subjectivity, there is an emerging tendency in which the designer assumes a central role as a character in the work. This tests the way the treatment of given material — what van Toorn might call the critical perspective — amounts to a kind of authorship.

- The question is: does banality have an agenda? Is anything advanced except the blasé, detached bemusement of the designer? Has Holland become so comfortable, so completely designed, that the only thing left is ironic commentary on the act of designing itself? Does anyone think about a kind of makeable society, or have we just given up? Design may have become a free-floating reaction, all verb without direct object.

    - Note: so interesting he cant conceive of design commenting on any issues outside of the design discipline itself
- “What we have… drawn from postmodernism is the realization that there are no objective, neutral or universal values. But that does not discourage us from pursuing those values; that is our modernist inheritance. In the end, we’ve actually arrived at something of a synthesis of modernism and postmodernism; working with a utopia in mind, while being fully aware that we will never achieve that utopia.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg1ezgaeqjk3hwnb4xm9zw1g))
    - Note: i like… completely cosign this quote
- The kind of Dutch design that captures our attention now almost always has a layer of humor and reference that seems to say, like Experimental Jetset, we don’t really believe this, but let’s pretend anyway. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg1f1emkkhe0m4pk1csjrh2y))
    - Note: ok fair
