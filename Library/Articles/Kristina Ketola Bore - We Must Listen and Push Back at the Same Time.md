## Highlights
- I don’t see an educational setting as something that should aim for consensus—rather, this space provides room to metaphorically rub up against each other through disagreeing and discussing.
- Especially when teaching theory I believe we often forget to think about how image-making comes from the body, and that the body is part of making both objects and ideas, as well as enacting those objects.
- As educators, we often act from the position of facilitating students’ own discoveries. But how do we enact this ideal when faced with concepts that so obviously violate ideas we believe in and somehow, ironically, threaten the act of speaking freely?
- Therefore, my question is: When is it time to speak up and push back, and when is it time to listen?
    - Note: Is that it? I was really hoping for a little bit more detail. Maybe some suggested approaches, if not thought experiments about where following different approaches might lead. What bore.
