## Highlights
- “frequently founded on some unacknowledged misreading or misunderstanding.” (Owens, 2009, p. 327) He notes that ‘postmodernism’ was an exhausted term within fine art and architectural discourse by the time it started to take hold in graphic design in the late 1980s. Adding to the list of examples, he says that the same applied to the discussions of ‘graphic authorship’ in the 1990s and, more recently, the exploration of the term ‘relational design’ by retrofitting Nicolas Bourriaud’s ‘relational aesthetics.’
- As Owens points out in relation to other terms, its reading and interpretation are likely to generate misunderstandings in disciplinary discourse, but also overlaps with the applications developed in other disciplines.
- post-critical as “sharing a commitment to an affect-driven, non-oppositional, nonresistance, nondissenting, and therefore nonutopian, forms of architectural production.”
- Hays has notably described critical architecture as “one which is resistant to the self-confirming, conciliatory operations of a dominant culture and yet irreducible to a purely formal structure disengaged from the contingencies of place and time.”
- Blauvelt argues that Task Newsletter was being symptomatic of an installed, non-confrontational attitude in graphic design practice.
- “In my opinion the critical establishes a position. The post-critical does not. I’m not evoking a specifically architectural reference for the term, only alluding to the idea that there is nothing to define, uphold, be against, or resist, etc. The issuance of an object into the world does not necessarily establish a critical position. It is possible that we can have more objects and fewer critical positions.”
- The lack of ideology is the ideology.
- This opens up two additional possibilities: 1) the critical as criticool—visual formulas can be developed in order to rapidly make a project look critical; and 2) the critical as simply a synonym of thinking.
- The post-critical places itself beyond criticism, delusionally rendering the tradition that preceded its existence neglectable. Martin suggests that the post-critical avoids becoming obsessed with the past, looking instead optimistically to the future.
- The fierce competition from businesses of ready-to-use, categorised templates and logos, to crowd-sourced services such Fiverr or 99 Designs, will drastically reduce the need for typical graphic design work. People producing generic work via these services at reduced prices will, too, be out of work, replaced by automated, data-driven tasks.
