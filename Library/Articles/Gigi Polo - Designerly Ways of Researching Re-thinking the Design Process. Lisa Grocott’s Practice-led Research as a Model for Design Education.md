## Highlights
- Australian-born communication designer Lisa Grocott advocates for a paradigm shift in design education by re-configuring the conventional action-research paradigm into a peer-learning, reflective practice, in which the teacher undergoes a transformation from “depositor….prescriber….domesticator”6 to “facilitator ….integrator….synthesizer.”7
- Her unique contribution to the field of design education lies in the ways in which she re-thinks design education as an experiential process of continuous questioning opened to ambiguity.
- Between 2000 and 2004, she developed a teaching model based on peer learning that aimed to move away from the hierarchical, traditional educational system and allowed individual students to investigate their research interests.
- In figuring (out) Grocott interrogated new ways of designing communications through a new “designerly way of thinking.” In the process of rethinking design practice, the thing produced is an open-ended proposition, a conversation, that seeks understanding rather than fixing—since fixing implies a fixed solution to a problem whereas understanding comprises a criticality and reflectiveness that allows for the realm of possibilities to arise.14 In the act of figuring lies the capacity of design to be “performative, negotiative, adaptive, situated, and discursive” through the practice of research attributes—“purposive, inquisitive, informed, methodical, and communicable”.34
