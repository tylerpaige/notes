## Highlights
- The relative invisibility of design is also a matter of perceptual survival. Most new things are quickly absorbed into our immediate surroundings, forming the background against which we go about our everyday lives. Without this ability to integrate objects into our environment, the world would seem a daunting place-an ever-changing visual cacophony.
- The aforementioned examples belie the invisibility of design in the world at large. Indeed, they map the terrain in which design emerged as a potent force transforming products into lifestyles, companies into brands, and neighborhoods into destinations.
- In economies of the past, we understood the function of goods in terms of exchange value (worth) or use value (utility). The experience economy represents the systematic development of what philosopher Jean Baudrillard refers to as sign value (meaning).

- By suggesting the alienation experienced in modern society, which estranged people from a once holistic conception of life and work through the fragmentation and specialization of industrialized labor, Lefebvre argues against what much of everyday life had been reduced to, namely the drudgery and repetitiveness of work, bureaucratic social control, and empty consumerism.
- La production de l’espace (The Production of Space) has
- He countered the idea of classical and modernist notions of a universal, abstract space dominated by the visual by proposing instead a social space composed of differences. For him, space is a social product, not a neutral container, one that can encourage or discourage certain practices and behaviors.

- Lefebvre replies: “Surely there comes a moment when formalism is exhausted, when only a new injection of content into form can destroy it and so open up the way to innovation.”
- his belief that despite repressive aspects of modern society, there exists an element of creative resistance to these strictures enacted by ordinary people.
- Strategies are deployed against some external entity to institute a set of relations for official or proper ends, whether adversaries, competitors, clients, customers, or simply subjects. Tactics, on the other hand, are employed by those who are subjugated.
- For de Certeau, consumption is not merely empty or passive, as many critics claim, but can contain elements of user resistance-nonconformist, adaptive, appropriative, or otherwise transgressive tactics-that become creative acts of their own fashioning.
- Bakker’s Peep Show
- Yet, it is one thing to be part of the everyday-to help create it-and quite another to make it the subject of analysis or even critique.

- Seen through the professional’s eyes, the vernacular attains an exotic status, while the commonplace fades from view.
- Today’s everydayness is not reducible to period styles of the vernacular or the untrained informality of the anonymous. It accepts the bland, the generic, and the ordinary as the predominant context in which design will be situated, and against which the brand name and the spectacular operate.
- Against the rising cult of celebrity surrounding the architects of the 1990s building boom, the doctrines of everydayness advocate an antiheroic approach, opting to see architecture expressed as moments and cycles of habitation rather than in one-off monuments of expressiveness.

- The incompleteness, openness, and unpredictability of such projects are in opposition to most ideals of design, which typically demand a high degree of finish and see adaptation as a flaw, or chance as a risk.

- In a similar vein, the designers of Dialog—Marek Walczak, Michael McAllister, Jakub Segen, and Peter Kennard-explore the potential of digital technology to create alternative scenarios for computer-based experiences. Dialog (see pp. 110-113) counters the conventional notion of personal computing in which a single person interacts with the computer and perhaps with others online, but often alone and in isolation. Adopting the intrinsically social dynamics of a table as a gathering space, it allows multiple users to simultaneously explore a collection of ideas and artifacts.
- This increased mobility is fueled in part by the expansion of technology that can keep us tethered to the office,
- The trailer home’s mobility is really a by-product of its prefabrication, simply a method of transport to its site, where it is permanently anchored.
- It is the distinction between permanent and temporary habitation that colors people’s perceptions of portable housing. Typically understood as an acceptable solution for shorter periods of time, or in emergency situations, the portable home is seen by many as an escape from or loss of the everyday.
- Like the MDU, Portable House can be situated in a variety of locations for permanent or temporary stays, but unlike the MDU, it can be configured with other portable houses to form courtyards or other common spaces for social and outdoor gatherings.

- The problem of designing or studying the everyday is precisely the tension between its reality and its inevitable artificiality. In other words, when the concreteness or realness of everyday life is the subject of study or the intention of design, it becomes instead a kind of second nature-a reference to the real, a depiction of the ordinary, an allusion to the commonplace. Certainly nature is one such sphere where interventions by humans re immediately perceived to create a secondary effect, even if these anges are eventually effaced in our minds.
- longer agreed upon or even understood in the way it was originally onceived. Implicit in this strategy is the idea that design can be attuned the nuances of the quotidian without sacrificing innovation, inventiveness, novelty, or newness.
