## Highlights
- Design then becomes less of a tool of orientation and now a tool of attention, simulating responsiveness and even avoiding accountability.
- Mid-century government design may have been top-down, and even signaled the might and ideology of the state, but it was committed to the idea that systems should be intelligible.
    - Note: Lol
- On one side: biometric interfaces, border kiosks, dull sans-serif dashboards that remove any trace of human authorship. On the other hand: loud, emoji-filled posts begging for shares. Neither style is neutral. Both are symptoms of a state that no longer sees design as a means of care, but as a mechanism of management.
