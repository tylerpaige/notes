## Highlights
- entrepreneurial
- In 1934, the German critic Walter Benjamin wrote “The Author as Producer,” a text that attacked the conventional view of authorship as a purely literary enter-prise. He exclaimed that new forms of communication—film, radio, advertising, newspapers, the illustrated press—were melting down traditional artistic genres and corroding the borders between writing and reading, authoring and editing.
    - Note: i should read this!
- Benjamin argued that artists and photographers must not view their task as solely visual, lest they become mere suppliers of form to the existing apparatus of bourgeois publishing:
- Benjamin’s 1928 collection of essays, One-Way Street, reflects on experimental typography and the proliferation of such commercial media as the pamphlet, poster, and advertise-ment, which were upending the classi-cal book as literature’s sacred vessel.
- Such “new systems” are, of course, ubiquitous today in the form of software for word processing and desktop publishing. These tools have altered the tasks of graphic designers, enlarging their pow-ers as well as burdening them with more kinds of work to do. Such is the rub of de-specialization.
- Whereas the term “author,” like “designer,” suggests the cerebral workings of the mind, production privileges the activity of the body. Production is rooted in the material world. It values things over ideas, making over imagining, practice over theory.
- The challenge for design-ers today is to help become the masters, not the slaves, of technology.
- As Benjamin phrased it in 1934, the goal is to turn “readers or specta-tors into collaborators.”
