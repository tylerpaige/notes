## Highlights
- School: A Recent History of Self-Organized Art Education.
- Atkinson: Part of it might just be—at least for me—when you teach you’re not thinking about documenting your teaching, you’re thinking about teaching. It is curious when you look at some of that work, simply what was produced out of there, I think it’s really hard to understand for instance Soviet art of the time if you don’t understand that extended set of practices, because it was all about social formations and changing the social formations and education was a huge part of that.
