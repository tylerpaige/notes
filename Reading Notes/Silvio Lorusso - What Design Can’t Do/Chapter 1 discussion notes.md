## High-level description
Today’s graphic design context is a period of simultaneous self-importance (stemming from Modernism’s grand narratives of autonomy, self-determination and a rational society possible through design) and disillusionment (stemming from Neoliberalism’s breakdown of stable employment, collectivism; as well as post-modernism breakdown of grand narratives). The design figure who most embodies/endures this condition is the “Everyday Designer,” who is caught between poles of expertise and amateurism, recognized and anonymous, functional and impotent, employed and unemployed, etc. All late capitalist subjects experience this struggle — or at least one related to it — but there may be reason to believe the designer specifically is a canary in the coal mine.

## Context
* 2023 was the first days of general consumer AI usage
* Writing at least 40 years after post-fordism became the primary economic mode
* Writing at the end of the neoliberal age, although no one really knows yet what comes next
* In response to a preceding period of design optimism in the 2010s, related to “design thinking,” “critical design,” and “design research” which all imagined expanded fields of design, albeit towards different goals — thereby loosening our understanding what design *is* and *isn’t* 
* Design as a profession continues to disintegrate, or at least is undergoing major transformation (as it has basically since invention) as it becomes
	* democratized (think templatized tools like Canva, generative tools like Figma Make)
	* generalized (graphic designers have to be ux designers, motion designers, marketers, brand consultants, strategists, book designers, writers, theorists)
	* done by other people who don’t consider themselves designers
